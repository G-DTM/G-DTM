It was another eventful week in the United States. On Monday, the supreme court struck down a restrictive law that could have undone the landmark Roe v Wade abortion decision. Meanwhile, it was revealed that Russia had allegedly offered bounties for attacks on US forces in Afghanistan (something the president was told about in February, despite saying last weekend he hadn't been).
But of biggest concern to US citizens (if not the commander-in-chief) is an enormous spike in new coronavirus cases that has seen states that had reopened from lockdown, including Texas and Arizona, shutting back down again. With other wealthy countries seemingly managing the decline of the outbreak, the situation in the US looks like it could be a renewed public health disaster.
The federal mishandling of the response to coronavirus, alongside Trump's heavy-handed treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters (not to mention behaviour such as tweeting a video that featured someone shouting "white power") has led to a major slump in the polls for the president, who is behind nationally and in all the crucial swing states. But, reports David Smith, we've been here before – and though the situation looks worse for him than it did in 2016, now Trump has the full apparatus of the state at his disposal. And Joe Biden, currently riding high despite his low-key campaign, knows a barrage is coming.
There was more dramatic news from Hong Kong on Tuesday, with the passage in Beijing of a controversial new national security law for Hong Kong that may allow China to cement its control of the territory. The aim of the law is to prevent further protests against Chinese control in Hong Kong. The bill is the latest stomach punch to pro-democracy activists, who will now be taking extraordinary risks in standing up to Beijing. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu report on what we know about the law so far.
Coronavirus might be running wild in the US but its impact is also being felt in almost every nation on Earth. In the UK, Leicester became the first to suffer a localised lockdown this week, as prime minister Boris Johnson announced his plans for a Rooseveltian "new deal" to revive the economy. This week we look at the impact the virus will have on the previously lucrative London office market (Julia Kollewe, p20); John Harris writes about the pandemic of hunger that the virus has caused in the UK; and Martin Kettle laments the difference in responses between the UK and Germany, concluding that the two European nations may as well be on different planets.
