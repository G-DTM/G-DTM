Looking back on the protests that have shaken America
Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn looks back at the 11 days of protest that started in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd, but quickly spread across the rest of America and then the world
Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn tells Rachel Humphreys about why she was not surprised that protests that took place immediately after the death of George Floyd, who died after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, knelt on his neck despite his pleas that he could not breathe. But Kenya says she has been surprised by the speed and urgency.
She tells Rachel why the global pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted African Americans, and which has lead to an economic downturn, which has also disproportionately impacted the African American community, alongside the systemic racism that already exists, has all played a part in creating the conditions for the protests to grow so rapidly.
