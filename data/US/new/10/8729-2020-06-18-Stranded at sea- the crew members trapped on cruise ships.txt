Stranded at sea: the crew members trapped on cruise ships
Guardian US reporter Erin McCormick describes why thousands of crew are still stranded on cruise ships after coronavirus bought the industry to a standstill in March. Will Lees describes how it took him 82 days to get back to Canada while Perry, who hasn't had a salary since March, is still stuck and doesn't know when he will get home to his family in Mauritius
Guardian US reporter Erin McCormick tells Rachel Humphreys why up to 80,000 crew are still stranded on cruise ships amid the coronavirus crisis. While most cruise ship passengers have now made it back to land, many crew workers are trapped, quarantined in tiny cabins, some without pay. Crew members have said the experience has taken its toll on their mental health. Cruise companies have blamed strict rules from health authorities for not letting crew disembark.
Rachel hears from Will Lees, a Canadian who last October took a job as an art director on board the Norwegian Star cruise ship. When coronavirus hit in March, he found himself unable to get off. Shuffled between ships to await repatriation, he was eventually taken to Italy, where he was finally able to fly home. Perry*, a Mauritian crew member, is still stuck on his boat. With two cases of coronavirus onboard, Perry and fellow crew have been confined to their cabins for months. He does not know when he will be allowed home and is worried about how his family, who depend on his salary to support themselves, are managing. He has not been paid a wage since March.
*Perry's name has been changed.
