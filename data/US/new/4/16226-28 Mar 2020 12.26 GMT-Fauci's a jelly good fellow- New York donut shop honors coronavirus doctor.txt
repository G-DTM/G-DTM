Fauci's a jelly good fellow: New York donut shop honors coronavirus doctor
Many have wondered if Donald Trump is jealous of media attention showered upon Dr Anthony Fauci, the medical expert leading the White House effort to contain the coronavirus.
The 79-year-old director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has advised every president since Ronald Reagan. His straightforward communication style and calm demeanor while advising millions of Americans amid a terrifying pandemic – notably in contrast to the unpredictable president – have made him a national star.
Trump is known to be wary of those within his circle who attract such attention, particularly when they might be seen to be stealing the spotlight.
Dr Fauci's occasional absences from White House briefings have therefore become the subject of intense media speculation. And his latest honor may strike close to home for a president known to love sweet treats.
An upstate New York donut shop is featuring a likeness Dr Fauci on its goods – and they are selling "like crazy".
On Monday, Donuts Delite in Rochester began selling donuts featuring Dr Fauci's face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with patriotic sprinkles.
"We're watching the news like everyone else," franchisee Nick Semeraro told the Democrat &amp; Chronicle newspaper. "He's on TV giving us the facts. You've got to respect that. We're bipartisan, we stay neutral, but you've got to give credit where credit's due."
The shop hopes this new addition to their menu brings "light to a humbling experience", Semeraro said, and gives customers some cheer, "even if it's just while you're wolfing down that donut."
