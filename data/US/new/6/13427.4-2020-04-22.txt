Stay-at-home orders are causing heated debates in the states
Almost 20,000 Georgians have tested positive for the coronavirus, at least 86 died on Sunday and Monday alone, and the state still has no way to conduct widespread testing. But the governor, Brian Kemp, has joined the governors of Florida and South Carolina in planning to reopen parts of their states' economies over the weekend, a decision decried by the mayor of Savannah as "reckless, premature and dangerous". The situation pits Kemp, a white Republican, against Georgia's mostly black Democratic mayors.
In Wisconsin, by contrast, the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, is facing a legal challenge to his stay-at-home order from GOP state leaders, as the question of coronavirus lockdowns across the US becomes increasingly political and partisan.
South Dakota won't stay at home. Some governors refused to issue stay-at-home orders in the first place, including South Dakota, whose governor, Kristi Noem, told Fox News: "So many people give up their liberties for just a little bit of security, and they don't have to do that."
Missouri sues China. The Republican-led state of Missouri is suing China over the coronavirus, claiming the Chinese government is to blame for the pandemic.
