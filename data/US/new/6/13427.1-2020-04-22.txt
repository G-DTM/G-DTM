a second coronavirus wave could be worse than the first
The CDC director Robert Redfield says a new surge of infections in the winter months would coincide with the annual flu season. 
Good morning. In case you were beginning to feel optimistic about the flattening of the coronavirus curve, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a stark warning: the second wave of Covid-19 infections could prove "even more difficult" for the US than the first. If such a surge comes during the winter months, Robert Redfield told the Washington Post on Tuesday, it would coincide with the regular annual flu season, when the healthcare system is already strained.
The coronavirus has now killed more than 44,000 people in the US and 175,000 worldwide.
