Zaandam: onboard the coronavirus-hit cruise ship
The Guardian US reporter Erin McCormick charts the journey of the Zaandam cruise ship, which has docked in Florida after being stranded at sea with a Covid-19 outbreak
The Guardian US reporter Erin McCormick tells Anushka Asthana about the reporting she and Guardian reporter Patrick Greenfield have done on the Zaandam cruise ship, which first ran into trouble when Chile refused to allow it to dock in San Antonio on 21 March.
It has finally been able to dock in a port in Florida after previously being denied entry there, with four dead passengers onboard. Earlier in the week the ship offloaded its healthy passengers on to its sister-ship the Rotterdam, which has now also been given permission to dock.
