The devastating impact of Covid-19 in New York
The Guardian US health reporter Jessica Glenza reports from New York, where medical facilities and staff are being overwhelmed by the Covid-19 outbreak
New York City is a densely populated city that welcomes millions of visitors every month â€“ which in part explains why it's been hit so hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. With more than 2,000 deaths and a staggering 84,000 cases across the state, New York has now overtaken Wuhan in terms of the sheer number of Covid-19 patients.
The Guardian US reporter Jessica Glenza tells Mythili Rao about the seismic impact the virus is having on medical facilities and its staff, some of whom have said their hospitals are like war zones.
