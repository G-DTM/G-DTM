Woman, 106, leaves hospital after coronavirus recovery
Connie Titchen discharged from Birmingham City hospital after three weeks with virus
A 106-year-old woman is thought to be Britain's oldest patient to recover from coronavirus, after being discharged from Birmingham's City hospital.
Connie Titchen spent three weeks in hospital with the virus, but was given a clean bill of health by doctors this week.
The retired shop worker from Birmingham, who was born in 1913, said: "I feel very lucky that I've fought off this virus. I can't wait to see my family."
Her granddaughter Alex Jones said Titchen had lived a very active life.
"She loved to dance, cycle and play golf," Jones said. "She has always cooked for herself too, although she likes a cheeky McDonald's every now and then. I haven't told her they are closed.
"I think the secret of her old age is that she is physically active and very independent. She had a hip operation back in December and within 30 days she was walking again.
"She really is amazing and I know all the family can't wait to see her. She has quite a few fans!"
Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust said Titchen, who has eight great-grandchildren, was admitted to hospital with suspected pneumonia and diagnosed with coronavirus soon afterwards.
Jones, 40, added: "The care she has received at the hospital has been brilliant and I can't fault it. During her stay I was kept up to date constantly by the nurses looking after her which made me feel so happy.
"I want to thank the staff for all they have done for her during her stay."
Kelly Smith, a nurse who looked after Titchen in hospital, added: "It's been fantastic to see Connie recover. She is amazing and we've been doing our best to nurse her back to health.
"We were really pleased when she was given the all clear. It's nice to see patients leave our ward after having beaten this virus."
