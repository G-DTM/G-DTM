A £56m bill and rising: the cost of Covid consultancy contracts
Some of the most lucrative contracts received by firms such as PwC and Deloitte since the pandemic began
Since the onset of the pandemic, the government has spent tens of millions of pounds on management consultants to help it manage elements of the Covid-19 response, from the much-criticised NHS test-and-trace programme to buying PPE.
Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that at least £56m of taxpayers' money had gone to companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and McKinsey for their help with initiatives that often have not run smoothly.
Even more has been spent since then, in what has become a fee-earning bonanza for some of the world's largest professional services firms.
Here are some of the most lucrative contracts picked up by management consultants.
Deloitte won a £6.7m contract to help the government buy equipment for intensive care units, including mechanical ventilators
The same company earned £3m for providing the Cabinet Office with "general management consultancy services" related to the pandemic
The Department of Health paid Deloitte £2.2m for help with buying PPE too
Rival PwC picked up £3m from the Cabinet Office for financial analysis
It also won a £2.5m contract from the Treasury for general consultancy and research
PwC also has a £1.4m contract from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to help run a £200m emergency coronavirus fund for small charities struggling to raise funds

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has grabbed some of the biggest contracts, including £5m to provide digital support for the NHS test-and-trace programme
