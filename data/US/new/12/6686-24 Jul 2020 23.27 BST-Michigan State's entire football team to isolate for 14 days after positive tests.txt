Michigan State's entire football team to isolate for 14 days after positive tests
Michigan State University said on Friday that all members of its football team will quarantine or isolate after another staff member and an athlete tested positive for Covid-19.
The team had already paused workouts once after a staff member tested positive on Wednesday. The athletic department said Friday that testing conducted over the last week included a second staff member and an athlete testing positive.
"As part of the athletic department's return to campus policy, student-athletes quarantine when coming into close contact with an individual who tests positive for COVID-19," the school said in a statement. "The university has designated areas available to house individuals in quarantine as needed based upon the living arrangements for student-athletes."
All members of the football team will quarantine or isolate, while awaiting completion of a 14-day quarantine, the athletic department.
Surveillance testing of athletes was completed Wednesday and is set to be repeated before they are cleared to return to workouts.
Earlier Friday, senior offensive lineman Jordan Reid shared his concerns over the team's continuing to practice amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, tweeting: "Guys are testing positive across the country left and right...why is there still discussion on a season? Why is it taking so long to make a logical decision? Hmm let me guess REVENUE #NCAA #B1G10"
The announcement came as the state's health department reported 594 new confirmed virus cases and three additional deaths. About 3.7% of tests have been positive this week as of Thursday.
Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer extended a ban on family visitors at nursing homes and congregate care sites through 31 August. There's an exception for people who want to see someone in serious or critical condition or in hospice care. Whitmer's office announced an extension of her previous order Thursday night.
Facilities must make "best efforts" to help residents communicate with people by phone or electronic devices, Whitmer said.
Some people in nursing homes and assisted-living centers have only seen visitors through a window.
"We must remain vigilant in our fight against Covid-19 and protect our most vulnerable citizens from the spread of this virus. ... I know seniors and their families are making sacrifices every day during this crisis," Whitmer said.
