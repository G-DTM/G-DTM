Wide disparities exist in states such as Missouri, where black and Latino people make up 40% of those infected, despite comprising just 16% of the state's population.
African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago, which is 30% black, and more than half of the state's deaths, by early April. This rate has since declined somewhat but black people are dying of Covid at a rate two to three times higher than white people in Chicago.
