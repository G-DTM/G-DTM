Trump versus Biden 2020: the most unpredictable election in history â€“ podcast
The US presidential campaign is usually in full swing by this stage of the political cycle, but the coronavirus pandemic has put a halt to rallies and fundraising events. David Smith in Washington looks at how the race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden is playing out
This episode first aired on Today in Focus, the Guardian's global daily news podcast made by the Guardian team in London.
No sooner had senator Joe Biden staged a remarkable political comeback to seal the Democratic party's presidential nomination than he was forced into lockdown as coronavirus struck. In the White House, Donald Trump switched from holding rallies to hosting freewheeling daily coronavirus press conferences. As the economy was forced into shutdown and the death toll grew, his poll ratings began to drop.
The Guardian's Washington bureau chief, David Smith, tells Rachel Humphreys that this is an election campaign like no other. Trump has been determined to offload any blame for the current crisis on to the media, the previous administration and China. Biden, stuck campaigning from his basement in Delaware, has been forced to defend himself from allegations of sexual assault brought by a former staffer.
There are plenty of chapters in this race still to unfold before election day in November, but already the 2020 race is proving to be one of the most unpredictable in history.
