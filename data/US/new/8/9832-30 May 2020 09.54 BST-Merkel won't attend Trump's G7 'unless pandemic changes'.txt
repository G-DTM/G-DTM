Merkel won't attend Trump's G7 'unless pandemic changes'
German chancellor will monitor spread of coronavirus before committing to meeting
The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will not attend a face-to-face meeting in the US with the leaders of the world's major economies if Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said.
After cancelling the G7 summit, originally scheduled for 10 to 12 June at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was considering rescheduling an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a "great sign to all" of things returning to normal during the pandemic.
Immediately after that announcement, Merkel suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office told the dpa news agency on Saturday she had now made a decision.
"As of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot commit to participating in person," her office said. It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things changed.
