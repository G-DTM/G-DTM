Will Trump's handling of Covid-19 be his undoing? Politics Weekly Extra
After a week in which so much happened in the US, Jonathan Freedland talks to the Guardian US columnist Moira Donegan about why the pandemic might be the one issue Trump can't talk his way out of, and to Lauren Gambino about what swing states tell us about modern US politics
Over the last week we saw the US president test positive for Covid-19, his helicopter ride to the Walter Reed medical centre, his spin in the backseat of an SUV and then his return to the White House, not forgetting his upbeat video message once he was back.
So much happened that rather than trying to tackle one big question about the US election, we decided to take on two.
Will Donald Trump's handling, or mishandling, of the pandemic be his undoing? And what can the swing states tell us about modern US politics? Plus, a quick look at Wednesday's vice-presidential debate.
