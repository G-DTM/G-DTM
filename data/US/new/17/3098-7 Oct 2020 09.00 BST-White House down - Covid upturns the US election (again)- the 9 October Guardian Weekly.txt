The old adage is that a week is a long time in politics – this year's US election is making a day in politics feel like an eternity. Since we went to press last week, hot off revelations about Donald Trump's tax returns, we witnessed the miserable spectacle of the first presidential debate in Cleveland.

You can read Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner's 2020 climate pledge in this week's issue. Before that, Oliver Milman analyses the fledgling carbon capture industry .

Then, on the opinion pages, John Harris looks at those "red wall" seats – are Britain's political classes misunderstanding them again?
One of the hardest-hit industries from the pandemic has been air travel. With borders shut and billions facing restriction on their movements, the airline industry knew in March that it was facing disaster. Will it survive the crisis? Samanth Subramanian has spent the past few months speaking to industry insiders about the future – and discovering what happens to a fleet of planes that can't go anywhere. (It's not quite as simple as parking them up for six months … )
