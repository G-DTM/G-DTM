'Covid-19 in the White House' – what the papers say after Trump's positive test
British newspaper front pages as the US president, Donald Trump, goes into hospital with coronavirus
Some of the UK papers play the big story of the moment with a fairly straight bat but others draw attention to the irony of Donald Trump testing positive for coronavirus, having repeatedly played down the pandemic.
The i puts one of the president's innumerable tweets at the centre of its front page. The headline is "Covid-19 in the White House" and the tweet from February says: "The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA".
The Mail's early edition went in hard with "How many did Trump put at risk?" saying the White House "denied mounting a cover-up" after the president went to a gala despite knowing an aide had tested positive.
But that tone softened markedly in an updated edition to become "Virus-hit Trump in hospital" with the focus being on the treatment that the president is receiving.
Our Guardian front page says "US election chaos as Trump hospitalised with Covid-19". The third edition shows the president wearing a mask as he leaves the White House.
The FT's wording is similar: "Trump's positive coronavirus test throws US election into turmoil".
The Times' presses also needed a plate change for the late edition. Its initial splash was "Hopes grow for vaccine", about the Oxford project to produce a jab. Later as news spread that the president was being hospitalised, the paper switched to "Trump flown to hospital".
An update too for the Telegraph which started off the print run with "Trump 'will remain on the job" but finished up with "Trump taken to hospital".
(The newspapers tend only to tweet their first editions, so credit to Allie Hodgkins-Brown of the BBC for putting the updated versions out there on Twitter).
The Express splashes with what would seem an odd choice for today in any other paper – Boris Johnson revamping a line that dates back to before the referendum – with "PM: Brexit billions freed up for new hospitals".
The Mirror also casts its eyes elsewhere for a lead story with "Wag war court shock … Colleen: my proof". But its final edition gets the big global story into a puff/skybox saying "Trump taken to hospital with Covid".
And the Sun flipped things round dramatically – initially splashing with Meghan and Harry, while playing the story of the day down as "Trump's Covid sickness 'mild'" …
… before switching to "Prez Covid crisis – Trump flown to hospital" with "Betrayal of Megxit shock" relegated to the puff.
