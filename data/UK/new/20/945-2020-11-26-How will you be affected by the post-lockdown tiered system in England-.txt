How will you be affected by the post-lockdown tiered system in England?
We would like to hear how you feel about the new tiers, especially if you live in tier 1, and how they might affect you
When lockdown ends in England next week, a new three-tier system of restrictions in England has been set out by the prime minister, including the reopening of shops and gyms, and letting crowds return to sporting events. Pubs and restaurants, however, will face tougher measures.
For hospitality businesses in tier 2, alcohol can only be served with a "substantial meal", while in tier 3 all pubs, restaurants and cafes must close apart from for delivery or takeaway.
We would like to hear your reaction to the latest announcement about tiers, especially from those who live in tier 1 â€“ are you concerned about people visiting your area? If you live in tier 2, will you be planning a holiday to a place in tier 1? If you are a business owner or employee, how will being in tier 3 affect you?
