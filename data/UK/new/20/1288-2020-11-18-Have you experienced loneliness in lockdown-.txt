Have you experienced loneliness in lockdown?
We want to hear how the coronavirus lockdown might have increased feelings of loneliness or whether these feelings are new
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, Britain saw the highest levels of loneliness since the start of the pandemic the week after the clocks went back.
Those who were particularly feeling cut off were young people between 16-29, who were found to be twice as likely as those over-70 to have experienced loneliness during the pandemic.
We'd like to understand how the lockdown might have increased pre-existing feelings of loneliness or whether these feelings are new.
Whether video calling or other tech is helping to alleviate your isolation, or if you have found any coping mechanisms or lessons to take forward for when our lockdown period ends, we'd like to hear from you.
