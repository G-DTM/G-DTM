Share your tributes and memories of UK coronavirus victims who died in the second wave
We would like you to share your tributes for friends and family who have died during the summer months
Covid-19 has now cut short the lives of at least 55,000 Britons. Since October the number of deaths from coronavirus has been on the rise once again, following a summer of eased restrictions and a rise in cases in September. But behind the figures are stories of family, friendship and love.
As the country continues to grapple with Covid-19, we would like you to share your memories and tributes for those who have died in the second wave - during the months of September, October and November.
