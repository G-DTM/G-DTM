More than 1,300 wrongly told they have Covid after Test and Trace lab error
Government's service voids results after problem with testing chemicals discovered
More than 1,300 people were wrongly told they had coronavirus due to a lab error with the government's Test and Trace service.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 1,311 people who took a test from 19-23 November across the UK were incorrectly told they received a positive result. It said there was an issue with a batch of testing chemicals which meant their results were void.
A DHSC spokesman said: "Swift action is being taken to notify those affected and they are being asked to take another test, and to continue to self-isolate if they have symptoms. This laboratory error was an isolated incident and is being fully investigated to ensure this does not happen again."
The DHSC did not comment on whether the error affected regionalinfection rate figures.
Duncan Larcombe, whose daughter received the wrong result, told the BBC it was "more than an inconvenient mistake". The PR company director, from Maidstone, Kent, said his 14-year-old daughter had not left her bedroom for four days, with meals being left outside her door, until the family learned the result was void on Thursday.
Test and Trace has been beset with issues, with figures earlier this week revealing about four in 10 contacts of those who test positive for the virus are still not being reached.
