Tell us: are you planning on going abroad on holiday from the UK?
We want to hear from people who have plans to travel outside the UK for a break
With the announcement of the new tiers in England which will come into place from 2 December, we would like to hear from those who are planning on travelling abroad.
Those living in tier 3 are unable to travel to other parts of the UK, other than where necessary, however there do not appear to be any restrictions on leaving the country.
Which country do you plan on going to and why? How do you plan on travelling safely? Do you have any concerns?
