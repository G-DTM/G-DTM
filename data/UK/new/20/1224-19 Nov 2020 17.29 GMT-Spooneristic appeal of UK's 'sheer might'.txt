Spooneristic appeal of UK's 'sheer might'
Departing leaders | Teachers' tales | Covid Christmas | Minister of the union | Spoonerism
In the US we have an egomaniac smashing up the house because he's been told he has to leave. Here we have Jeremy Corbyn determined to cause as much damage out of office as he did during his tenure as Labour leader (Labour in fresh turmoil as Starmer refuses to restore whip to Corbyn, 18 November). If bad behaviour becomes magnified once an incompetent incumbent leaves office, heaven help us when Boris Johnson departs.Amanda BakerEdinburgh
As an art school tutor in the 1970s (Letters, 17 November), I said to an early member of Duran Duran: "This music thing is OK, but have you thought of being a textile designer?"Tom JonesEdgbaston, Birmingham
So, the government plans to allow Christmas gatherings, with more severe restrictions before and after (England told to expect tougher Covid rules to allow for Christmas gatherings, 19 November). Is it really worth it? The letup will be very unfortunate for those who contract Covid-19 over Christmas and die. It is also an insult to those of other faiths who have endured lockdown over their major festivals.Rev C Mary AustinTibberton, Worcestershire
Marina Hyde lacks faith in Boris Johnson's commitment to the union (Boris Johnson's saboteur is back, and looking strangely familiar, 17 November). She should rest reassured that in 2019 he adopted the title minister of the union, channelling Henry VIII as defender of the faith.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire
Boris Johnson claimed the UK's response to the virus exemplified the "sheer might" of the union (Report, 17 November). It has been widely accepted in Scotland that this was a Spoonerism.Andrew JohnstoneDundee
