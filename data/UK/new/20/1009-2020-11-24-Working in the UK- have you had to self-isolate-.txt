Working in the UK: have you had to self-isolate?
We would like to hear from those who have had to stay at home and self-isolate
We would like to hear from workers who have had to self-isolate â€“ either after testing positive for Covid-19 or after being instructed to do so via test and trace after coming into contact with someone positive.
Was self-isolating a difficult decision to make? Can you afford to self-isolate? What support have you had from your employer? Have you received statutory sick pay? How are you coping at this time? What impact is this having on your household/family? Do you have any concerns?
