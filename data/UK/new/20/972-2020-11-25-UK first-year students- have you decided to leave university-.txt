We'd like to hear from first year students in the UK who have decided to leave university.
The coronavirus pandemic has caused increased disruption and hardship for many students around the UK as studies went online and students were forced to self-isolate.
But for first year students, starting out at university can be daunting at the best of times, and having to cope with the measures brought about by the pandemic has made the experience that much more challenging.
If you're in your first year and have decided to leave university, we'd like to hear from you and find out your reasons why.
We're also interested in those who have deferred until next year or have decided to go to another university, perhaps one closer to your home.
