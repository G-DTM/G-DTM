Hull residents: how have you been affected by coronavirus?
We want to hear from people living and working in Hull about how Covid has impacted them
With 770 cases per 100,000, Hull is soon to become the city with the highest cases in England, with the council leader saying that it has been "forgotten" by central government.
We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences. We're also interested in hearing from those who are working directly with the pandemic, whether it's with the NHS or local test and trace.
