Shutdowns, Fifa and dealing with a general lack of football – Football Weekly
Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Philippe Auclair and Flo Lloyd-Hughes discuss football in the time of Covid-19, Karren Brady's suggestion, Phil Neville's time running out, correspondents on lockdown and a prize pig
Join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.
We start by discussing the changing face of football in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, before speaking to Sid Lowe, who is currently in lockdown at his Madrid home, and Archie Rhind-Tutt, who is living in Cologne.
We talk to Suzy Wrack about the SheBelieves Cup, Phil Neville and the ongoing rift at the heart of US Soccer, before wrapping up with a few suggestions, sent in by listeners, of how to pass the time without football.
Back on Thursday.
