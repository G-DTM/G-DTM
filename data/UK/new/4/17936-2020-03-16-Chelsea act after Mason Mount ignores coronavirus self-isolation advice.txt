Chelsea act after Mason Mount ignores coronavirus self-isolation advice
Chelsea have spelt out the importance of following self-isolation advice to all their players after Mason Mount was pictured having a kickabout with West Ham's Declan Rice at a football centre in London on Sunday.
Chelsea are in lockdown after the winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for coronavirus â€“ a result announced in the early hours of Friday. They have closed part of their training ground and told their squad and coaching staff to self-isolate in accordance with government health guidelines.
This has meant not going to public places. Mount, however, sparked outrage by visiting a football centre near Barnet where he had a game with friends, including Rice.
West Ham's players are not in self-isolation, althoughDavid Moyes and his assistants did have to follow the procedure for seven days after coming into contact with the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, after the recent match between the clubs. Arteta tested positive for Covid-19 but neither Moyes nor any of this staff showed symptoms.
Chelsea's players will return to training on Sunday or thereafter and the club have reminded their squad they have to respect self-isolation as the country fights to delay the spread of the virus. The Premier League has been suspended until 4 April.
