Coronavirus: the race to rescue the UK's self-employed
Today the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce that the taxpayer will pay self-employed workers up to 80% of their recent earnings to help contain the economic impact of coronavirus. Mark Cairns, an Uber driver, and Rob Booth, the Guardian's social affairs editor, discuss the impact of Covid-19 on gig economy workers and the self-employed
Mark Cairns has been driving for Uber for years. He was recently forced to self-isolate over fears he might have Covid-19 after a friend texted to say he had had symptoms. Now Mark has no way of earning a living and is worried that once his savings run out next month, he and his family will be left without any way of surviving.
He talks to Rachel Humphreys about his anger that the government is not providing more assistance to the self-employed. The Guardian's social affairs editor, Rob Booth, tells Rachel about what kind of help workers in the gig economy can expect from their companies and looks at why the government has delayed offering more help to the self-employed.
