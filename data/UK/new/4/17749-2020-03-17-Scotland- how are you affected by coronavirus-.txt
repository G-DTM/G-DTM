Scotland: how are you affected by coronavirus?
If you live in Scotland, we want to hear how your local community is reacting to coronavirus
On Monday, Boris Johnson announced that people should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other social venues and that over-70s should avoid unnecessary social contact, to stem the spread of coronavirus.
We want to hear from people working in the Scottish healthcare system, small business owners, Airbnb and hotel owners, teachers and anyone whose daily life is affected by the new measures.
How has your daily life been affected? How is your local community coping with coronavirus? Do you have any concerns about what the measures might mean for you, your job or your business? If you run an Airbnb property or are a hotel owner, what will the drop in tourism mean for you?
