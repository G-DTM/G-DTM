Glenn Patterson and what to read while self-isolating â€“ books podcast
Glenn Patterson is a Northern Irish writer who made his debut in 1988 with Burning Your Own, an award-winning coming-of-age tale set at the start of the Troubles, in 1969. His most recent novel, Where Are We Now? tells the story of a bewildered divorcee who is trying to make a new life in a rapidly renewing Belfast.
And as the coronavirus dominates headlines and more people self-isolate, Sam Jordison, the person behind the Guardian's Reading group and Tips, links and suggestions blog, talks to Claire and Sian about reading while stressed and whether this is the time to go for dystopias or comforting reads.
