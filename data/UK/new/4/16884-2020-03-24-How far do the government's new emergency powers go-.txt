How far do the government's new emergency powers go?
A new government bill that brings sweeping new powers to shut down mass gatherings, potentially detain people with coronavirus symptoms and weaken the social care safety net is being rushed through parliament. The Guardian's Peter Walker explains what is at stake
A government bill being fast-tracked through parliament will bring with it sweeping new powers to restrict public gatherings and even detain people who show symptoms of coronavirus. It also includes powers to streamline funeral processes and weaken the social care safety net in times of crisis.
The Guardian's political correspondent Peter Walker tells Anushka Asthana that in any other context the measures would be hugely controversial but so far opposition to the substance of the bill has been minimal. However, as with the extraordinary new economic measures, these new laws will drastically alter our relationship with the state â€“ even if only temporarily.
