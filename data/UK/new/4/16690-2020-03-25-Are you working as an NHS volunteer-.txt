Are you working as an NHS volunteer?
We would like to hear from those who have started working for the NHS to help fight back against the pandemic
Following a call from Matt Hancock , more than 500,000 people have signed up to volunteer to help the NHS tackle coronavirus.
If you have offered to help the NHS during this time and have started working, we would like to hear from you.
What are your reasons for volunteering? Do you have any concerns? We are also interested in hearing from people who used to work for the NHS – in any capacity – who are returning to the health service.
