Do you have a travel question about coronavirus?
If you have a question about a holiday you've booked or getting a refund, we'd like to hear from you
With official advice constantly changing and tour operators and airlines adjusting their booking policies, what can you do if you have a trip planned in the coming weeks or months?
We will be online to answer your questions, such as can you postpone your trip without incurring charges? And can you get a refund if you decide to cancel a UK trip? Send us your question, and we'll do our best to answer as many as we can.
The Q&amp;A is now closed for questions
