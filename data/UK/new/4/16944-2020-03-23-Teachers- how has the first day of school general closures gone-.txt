Teachers: how has the first day of school general closures gone?
We would like to hear from teachers and people who work at schools about how children are now being taught.
Only the children of those considered key workers by the British government are now attending schools after general closures began on Monday because of the coronavirus. The majority of children will remain at home after the UK became the latest country to close its schools for the foreseeable future, with all exams cancelled, in the first countrywide school shutdown in modern British history. But children still need to be educated, entertained and reassured.
Are you a teacher sending work home to children? What do schools' online offering for pupils, if any, comprise of? Are you doing online classes for the first time? Or are you going into school to teach key workers' children and vulnerable pupils?
What is your opinion of the government's approach to closing schools at this point in the pandemic? How has the first day gone? Have some parents preferred to homeschool their children? Could you continue like this until the summer holidays?
