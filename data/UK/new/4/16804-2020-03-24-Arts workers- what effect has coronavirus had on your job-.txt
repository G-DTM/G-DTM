Arts workers: what effect has coronavirus had on your job?
After redundancies were suddenly made across arts venues forced to close their doors, we want to hear from you
Arts workers in the UK are facing a bleak future as institutions bleed cash while millions fall through the cracks of government support schemes, with many now mounting debt.
Warning that British theatre is on the brink of ruin, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, James McAvoy, and dozens of leading cultural figures last week called for urgent government investment to keep institutions afloat and livelihoods intact amid concerns that arts venues may not reopen before next year.
If you are an arts worker, whether salaried, temporary or freelance, we want to hear from you. We are especially interested in hearing from black, Asian and ethnic minority actors, theatre workers, producers, technicians and those in other roles in the arts who have concerns.
