2019 seemed like a crazy year, but then 2020 came along.
Just weeks ago, Boris Johnson was basking in his new majority and setting out his plans to "level up" Britain. But he now knows he'll forever be the coronavirus prime minister.
On Monday, the government radically stepped up its approach to the virus, advising what the prime minister admitted were unprecedented peacetime measures.
On Tuesday night, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, laid out the latest in the government's action plan for helping UK businesses survive. This action plan doesn't come cheap. The chancellor announced Â£330bn in state-backed loans for businesses and individuals affected by the virus.
So, will the government be able to keep the UK economy afloat? How will it reassure the public who don't trust the science they're being presented with? Will Johnson's premiership be overshadowed by his response to a global pandemic, and how are voters likely to react either way?
To discuss the government's response to the spread of Covid-19 and what prospects await us on the other side, Heather Stewart is joined by Miatta Fahnbulleh, the chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, Polly Mackenzie, a former Lib Dem adviser who's currently at the thinktank Demos, and Ryan Shorthouse, the founder and chief executive of the thinktank Bright Blue.
