London fire tests emergency response amid coronavirus crisis
Blaze breaks out at flat above supermarket at Charles Square near Old Street roundabout
Emergency services faced a test of their ability to cope against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic as firefighters fought to contain a major blaze at a flat above a supermarket in London.
About 10 pumps and dozens of officers from London fire brigade (LFB) were in attendance at Charles Square near Old Street roundabout in Shoreditch, east London, on Thursday morning.
There were no casualties as a result of the fire, which broke out at a flat above a branch of Sainsbury's.
A BBC producer tweeted video of fire and billowing black smoke coming from the centre of the blaze.
The LFB said 70 firefighters tackled the blaze after it was called just after 11am on Wednesday. It said part of a flat and terrace on the third floor of the building were alight.
Covid-19 has depleted some ranks of the police and other emergency services. Andy Roe, London's fire commissioner, has pledged to maintain a full emergency response in the city.
The National Fire Chiefs Council said on Wednesday it had seen a number of wildfires and urged landowners not to undertake unnecessary controlled burning at a time when fire and rescue services were under pressure.
The council's chair, Roy Wilsher, also said they were seeing a rise in deliberate fires. He said: "During these unprecedented times, the fire service is working hard to ensure the safety of the community, doing their upmost to protect the most vulnerable. However, it is unbelievable that we have seen a rise in deliberate fires reported in some areas in the past few days. All services are already under increased pressure; this is just piling more on to already stretched resources."
