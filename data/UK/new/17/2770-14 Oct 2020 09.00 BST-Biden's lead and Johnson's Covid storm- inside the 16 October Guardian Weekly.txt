For those nervous about the prospect of a second Trump term, election polling models tracking towards the likelihood of a Joe Biden victory in November has been a reassuring sight. Both national polling averages and surveys in many crucial swing states give the Democratic challenger a decent-sized lead – one that would withstand a similar polling error to the one seen in 2016. But, as Chris McGreal discovers, Democratic activists in states such as Wisconsin still fear the impact of the president's attacks on democracy – and, with the heartbreak of four years ago still fresh – are loath to be complacent with just a few weeks to go. On page 13, Simon Tisdall ponders the global events that could yet upset a Biden victory, while Ed Pilkington looks at how Donald Trump has responded to his Covid sickness. (Hint: not incredibly sensibly…)
In the United Kingdom, prime minister Boris Johnson spent last weekend with regional leaders in northern England trying to agree plans for clearer local lockdown rules. On Monday, Johnson addressed the House of Commons and later the nation via a television briefing to spell out a new tiered system for England (the rest of the UK has its own rules). The new levels put Liverpool and its surrounding area at the highest level of alert, while regions such as Greater Manchester could soon join them if infection and hospitalisation rates don't slow down. We outline the new rules from page 15, while our science editor Ian Sample analyses the tier system and wonders if – once again – it is too little, too late. Finally, in opinion, the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley weighs up the effectiveness of new restrictions versus anger about them in the Conservative party and suggests that even stormier waters may be ahead for the prime minister.
The fighting continues in Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed ethnic-Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan. As a ceasefire came and went last weekend, amid hundreds of military casualties, our Turkey and Middle East correspondent Bethan McKernan headed to the region's de facto capital, Stepanakert, to see the impact of shelling and drone strikes on the civilian population. Is there an endgame for this decades-old dispute?
This week we also feature a compelling report by Kris Manjapra on how the centuries-old fight for reparations from slavery is starting to be won. Then Patrick Greenfield reports from Costa Rica on a project to "barcode" the planet's biodiversity – while there's still time. And in culture we look at the future of the cinema in the wake of more movie delays. Is there one?
