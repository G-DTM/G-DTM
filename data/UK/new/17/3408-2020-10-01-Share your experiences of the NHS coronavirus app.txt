Share your experiences of the NHS coronavirus app
We'd like to hear about your experiences of using or downloading the new NHS coronavirus app
After months of pilot studies, the NHS coronavirus app has finally arrived in England and Wales. The app is designed to alert users if they have been within two metres of someone who tested positive for coronavirus, allow users to easily check in at venues, and book coronavirus tests.
However, its launch has been marred by reports that users were initially unable to share positive test results with the app, and fears that uptake could be as low as 10% of smartphone users.
