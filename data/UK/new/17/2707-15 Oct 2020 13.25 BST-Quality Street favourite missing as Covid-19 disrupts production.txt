Quality Street favourite missing as Covid-19 disrupts production
Absence of chocolate caramel brownie was noticed but all lines are back up and running
The coronavirus crisis has hit the production of Quality Street. Fans of the chocolate caramel brownie, added to the sweet selection last year, have been reporting them missing from their boxes.
The sweets, which are produced by the confectionery firm Nestlé, are one of 12 varieties included in the selection, which are a popular staple of many households' Christmases.
Nestle said the missing chocolate caramel brownies were a result of changes that had to be made during lockdown when some of its workers were either shielding or looking after children and family members at home.
A Nestlé spokesperson said: "In order to keep Quality Street production going during the Covid-19 lockdown period, we made some temporary changes to the way we operated, such as running fewer lines for a time.
"As a result, some consumers may find that they do not have all 12 varieties of Quality Street sweets in their mix."
Nestlé said that all 12 lines were back up and running and had been for some time.
"We apologise for any disappointment caused but hope consumers understand why it was necessary to make these changes during such unprecedented conditions," the spokesperson added.
In a sign that customers are already turning their thoughts to Christmas, there has been a rush of orders on a Quality Street website launched last week selling personalised tins.
The company said it had put on extra shifts to manage orders and was warning customers that deliveries may take longer than expected.
