Midlands residents: how are you affected by the local lockdown?
We want to hear from people living and working in the Midlands about how coronavirus restrictions will impact them
On Wednesday morning, much of the West Midlands was placed into the tier 2 "high risk" category, banning all household mixing indoors.
The region's Conservative mayor has warned that restrictions, also in place across most of the north of England, imposed on his region will cause severe economic damage.
We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences. We're also interested in hearing from those who are working directly with the pandemic, whether it's with the NHS or local test and trace.
