Living in the UK: have you been made unemployed during the pandemic?
We would like to hear from those who have lost their jobs due to coronavirus â€“ particularly young and older workers
Since June, 1.5 million people have been out of work in the UK, rising at the fastest rate since records began, with the youngest and oldest workers bearing the brunt of the employment crisis.
We would like to hear from people who have lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus. We are particularly interested in young and older workers who are especially affected, as well as those who have worked or now work in manual jobs.
