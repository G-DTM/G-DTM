London patients waiting 21 weeks for routine NHS blood tests
Serious incident declared over backlog caused by service suspension during Covid pandemic
Patients in north-east London are having to wait up to 21 weeks for a routine blood test on the NHS because a huge backlog built up when the service was suspended during the unfolding of the Covid pandemic.
Margaret Hodge, one of the local MPs, has warned that the hold-ups could lead to patients receiving a late diagnosis of their illness and being forced to wait many months to have surgery.
From 2 December, England will be divided into three different tiers of restrictions. They are slightly amended from the previous system.
Across all tiers, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector are set to reopen. Collective worship and weddings – with a maximum of 15 in attendance – can also resume.
Under the new system hospitality businesses in England can stay open until 11pm with table service only but last orders must be made by 10pm, in an effort to stagger departures. The"rule of six"will also remain in place indoors, meaning social household mixing is still allowed.
Spectator sport is set to resume, albeit with limits on numbers and abiding by social distancing. In tier 1, there will be a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of occupancy of the stadium or 4,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
In tier 1, people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. Support bubbles – which allowed a single household to join with another household – are also being broadened across all tiers. Parents with a child under one will be able to form a support bubble, as well as those with a child under five who needs continuous care, such as a child with a disability. Also, in cases where there is a single adult carer, for a partner with dementia for example, they would also be able to form a support bubble.

Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.
As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.
Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close.

Hospitality venues will have to close, except for delivery and takeaway service. In tier 3, hotels and other accommodation providers must also close, except for specific work purposes where people cannot return home. Outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, will be allowed to continue in all tiers, as will amateur team sports such as football. Unlike the first two tiers, spectators will not be allowed to watch sport in tier 3.

People with cancer, kidney problems, diabetes and eye problems are among those affected.
The huge delays have prompted the Barking and Dagenham, Havering and Redbridge NHS clinical commissioning group to declare the problem a "system serious incident" and launch an investigation into whether they have led to anyone being harmed. It is looking in particular at the clinical history of those who have had to wait the longest.
Hodge, the Labour MP for Barking and Dagenham, has written to Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, describing the delays as "wholly unacceptable" and demanding action.
The delays have been revealed in a letter to Hodge by Ceri Jacob, the managing director of Barking and Dagenham, Havering and Redbridge NHS clinical commissioning group.
In it, Jacob disclosed that waiting times for non-urgent blood tests at the 15 health centres in the three boroughs that offer the service range from four-and-a-half weeks to 21 weeks. The latter is the waiting time at the Elm Park Clinic in Havering.
In her letter, Hodge pinpoints the decision to suspend the blood testing service in March, when the pandemic was unfolding, as the main reason for such unusually long delays.
She outlined "the devastating impact Covid-19 has had upon blood test services in my constituency. For a routine blood test in Barking the current waiting time is anywhere between eight and 13 weeks".
She added: "It goes without saying that a three-month wait for a routine blood test is wholly unacceptable. If somebody is diagnosed with a serious illness, like cancer, where early treatment is vital, the delay could become a matter of life and death."
Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: "It has become clear that the emergency measures taken in the spring to free up NHS capacity for Covid-19 came at a heavy cost to non-Covid patients. Many people have been left feeling increasingly anxious over the suspension of planned treatment or their inability to get diagnostic tests.
"We know the NHS is working to restart these services, and aims not to have to suspend them in the same way during the second wave. It's important that they succeed."
This situation appears to be unrelated to the widespread rationing of blood tests the NHS was forced to impose last week after supply problems involving testing kits made by the pharmaceutical company Roche emerged.
Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, voiced unease at the delays.
"GPs will only request tests or make referrals when they consider it clinically necessary and beneficial in diagnosing a patient or helping to manage an existing health condition. As such, delays in tests being processed are both frustrating and concerning, for GPs and patients alike, particularly in cases where the results will determine or change a patient's treatment plan, and need to be addressed."
The Department of Health and Social Care declined to respond directly to the delays. In a statement, a spokesperson said: "We are supporting the NHS as it safely restores services providing £3bn specifically to help the NHS during winter and to update A&amp;E facilities."
This article was amended on 15 October 2020 because it was the Barking and Dagenham, Havering and Redbridge NHS clinical commissioning group that declared the system serious incident, not NHS England as an earlier version said.
