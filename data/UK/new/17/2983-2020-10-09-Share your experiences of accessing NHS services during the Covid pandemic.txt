Share your experiences of accessing NHS services during the Covid pandemic
How have your found accessing NHS services? Have there been any issues and if so have you considered alternatives such as switching to a private provider?
The coronavirus crisis has placed the NHS under major strain, with patients in England now facing record waiting times for surgery and cancer care.
We're looking to hear from people across the UK about your experiences accessing NHS and other health services over the past few months.
If you've had your surgery delayed, or struggled to get a GP appointment, we'd like to find out if you ever considered switching to a private provider, or an online health service? Is this a feasible option for you?
How has your physical and mental health been affected?
