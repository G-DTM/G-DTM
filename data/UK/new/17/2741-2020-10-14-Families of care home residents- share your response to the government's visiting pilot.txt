Families of care home residents: share your response to the government's visiting pilot
We would like to hear from families of people living in care homes about their response to the launch of a pilot scheme allowing family members to visit
A government pilot scheme which will see relatives of care home residents tested regularly to allow them to visit their loved ones is due to begin on Monday.
The scheme will launch in 20 care homes in Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall, but the government has said it hopes to roll out the plan across other regions by Christmas.
Organisations including Dementia UK and the Alzheimer's Society said social distancing regulations had caused a "hidden catastrophe" for people living in care homes, while care homes across the UK have seen regular coronavirus outbreaks.
We'd like to speak to care home staff, residents and their families about their experience of the coronavirus pandemic, and hear their reactions to the latest news.
