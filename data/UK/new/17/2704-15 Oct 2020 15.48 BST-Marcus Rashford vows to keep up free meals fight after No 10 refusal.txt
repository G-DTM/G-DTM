Marcus Rashford vows to keep up free meals fight after No 10 refusal
How many people are affected by poverty in the UK?
More than 4 million people in the UK are trapped in deep poverty, meaning their income is at least 50% below the official breadline, locking them into a weekly struggle to afford the most basic living essentials. Seven million people, including 2.3 million children, are affected by 'persistent poverty', meaning they were not only in poverty but had been for at least two of the previous three years.
The figures were calculated by experts from across the political spectrum who make up the Social Metrics Commission, set up in 2016 to developa new way of measuring poverty.
What are the definitions of poverty in the UK?
In cash terms, the Social Metrics Commission says 'deep poverty' is considered to be a couple with two children who have an income of less than £211 a week after housing costs, or a single parent with one child on less than £101.50 a week. A 'destitution' level of income is £140 a week for a couple with two children.
How have poverty rates changed in the UK?
Although overall rates of poverty have changed relatively little since 2000-01, certain groups – such as children, children of lone parents, and pensioners – have had hardship levels rise since 2013 as a result of austerity measures such as the benefit freeze, reversing earlier downward trends. There has been a dramatic rise in child poverty in families with three or more children, up 9% points since 2013-14.
How does having a disability affect poverty rates?
Disability is one of the strongest predictors of being in poverty. Nearly half of all those living below the breadline live in a household where someone is disabled.
How does being in work affect poverty rates?
Work is no longer a guarantee of protection against poverty. The proportion of people with a job who live in poverty went up for the third consecutive year in 2018 to a record high.The Joseph Rowntree Foundationsaid that while paid employment reduces the risk of poverty, about 56% of people living in poverty were also in a working household in 2018, compared with 39% 20 years ago.

PM's spokesman indicates government will not back calls for meals in school holidays
Marcus Rashford has vowed not to give in after Downing Street rejected his call for poorer children to be provided with free meals during school holidays.
A spokesman for Boris Johnson indicated that ministers would not support giving pupils food during breaks including Easter and Christmas.
Rashford, who forced the government into a U-turn on providing free school meal vouchers over the summer, tweeted: "Merry Christmas, kids … This is not going away any time soon and neither am I."
The 22-year-old, who was awarded an MBE last week for his recent campaigning, launched a parliamentary petition to end child food poverty.
The petition reached 100,000 just 10 hours after it was launched on Thursday, triggering consideration for debate in parliament.
It calls for three policy recommendations from the national food strategy to be implemented without delay:
Expand free school meals to under-16s in households where a parent is on universal credit.
Provide meals and activities during all holidays.
Increase the value of healthy start vouchers – which can be used by those who are pregnant or have a child under four to buy basic foods – from £3.10 to at least £4.25 a week.
A spokesman for the prime minister said on Thursday: "We took that decision to extend free school meals during the pandemic when schools were partially closed during lockdown. We're in a different position now with schools back open to all pupils.
"It's not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays. We believe the best way to support families outside of term time is through universal credit rather than government subsidising meals."
The Tory chair of the Commons education select committee, Robert Halfon, joined Rashford in criticising the government's refusal.
He tweeted: "This is very disappointing from@BorisJohnson @10DowningStreet. We need a long-term plan to combat child food hunger, especially given 32% of families have had a drop in income since March. @obr_uk [the Office for Budget Responsibility] predicts 336,500 more workers facing food insecurity due to rising unemployment."

Rashford's campaign over the summer won him widespread praise, and he formed a child poverty taskforce with major UK food brands. Launching the petition on Thursday, he said: "For too long this conversation has been delayed. Child food poverty in the UK is not a result of Covid-19. We must act with urgency to stabilise the households of our vulnerable children."
He added: "Right now, a generation who have already been penalised during this pandemic with lack of access to educational resources are now back in school struggling to concentrate due to worry and the sound of their rumbling stomachs. Whatever your feeling, opinion or judgment, food poverty is never the child's fault. Let's protect our young. Let's wrap arms around each other and stand together to say that this is unacceptable, that we are united in protecting our children."
