Scotland residents: how are you affected by the latest Covid restrictions?
We want to hear from people living and working in Scotland about how new coronavirus restrictions will impact them
A ban on drinking indoors in pubs, bars and restaurants across Scotland for 16 days is set to take place from Friday at 6pm. Places will have to operate a food and non-alcoholic drinks only service between 6am to 6pm, but can still serve alcohol outdoors until 10pm.
The harshest restrictions in the UK will affect central Scotland where licensed premises will be closed fully. Areas include Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, the Lothians, Ayrshire and Arran, and Forth Valley. People are still banned from visiting one another in their homes.
We'd like to hear from residents in Scotland about how they are affected by the harshest restrictions in the UK.
Whether you work in schools or businesses, particularly in hospitality, or are affected generally by the restrictions we want to hear your thoughts. We're also interested in hearing from those who are working directly with the pandemic, whether it's with the NHS or local test and protect.
