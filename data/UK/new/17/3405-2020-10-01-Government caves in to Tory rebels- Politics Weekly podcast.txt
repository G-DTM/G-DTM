Government caves in to Tory rebels: Politics Weekly podcast
Jessica Elgot and Sonia Sodha discuss the latest from Westminster, and Fiona Harvey updates us on Cop26 summit preparations. Plus, Polly MacKenzie and Naomi Smith review the Liberal Democrats' conference
On Wednesday, rebel Conservative MPs secured a deal to give the House of Commons more power over sweeping coronavirus restrictions. The government finally caved in to give MPs a vote in parliament on any new UK or England-wide coronavirus restrictions, after up to 100 Conservatives threatened a rebellion.

The Liberal Democrats' conference was last weekend. Later on, I speak to two former members of the party to discuss its path ahead.
Plus, Fiona Harvey reports on the latest news around the Cop26 UN climate change summit.
