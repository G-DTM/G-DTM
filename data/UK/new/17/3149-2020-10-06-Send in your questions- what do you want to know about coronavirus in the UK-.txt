Send in your questions: what do you want to know about coronavirus in the UK?
We want to hear about the questions you have around long Covid, testing and any other related issues
If you'd like to ask Guardian reporters a question about the impact of coronavirus in the UK, we'd like to hear from you.
As contact tracers in England try to reach up to 50,000 people who should be self-isolating after a spreadsheet blunder that led to coronavirus cases going unreported, we would like to hear about any questions you have about Covid-19.
If you have any questions about long Covid, about UK government policy, how contact tracing works, when we might see a vaccine, or any other question, please get in touch and our experts will try and provide the answers.
You can send us your questions by filling in the form below. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions.
