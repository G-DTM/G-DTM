The NHS official privately selling protective kit
Guardian reporters Harry Davies and Simon Goodley tell Rachel Humphreys how they tracked down and confronted a senior NHS procurement official who had set up a company offering PPE for private sale
When Guardian reporters Harry Davies and Simon Goodley learned that a senior NHS procurement official had set up a private business selling personal protective equipment (PPE) they set out to investigate.
They tell Rachel Humphreys how through an undercover alias purporting to be in the market for large quantities of PPE to enable the reopening of a meat packing factory, they discover that the official, David Singleton, is freely discussing his NHS role and his redeployment to the Nightingale hospital. He offers to link the undercover reporter to sellers of gowns, masks and other protective equipment.
In a statement since, Singleton has denied any conflict of interest but in light of the Guardian's investigation the NHS has launched an inquiry.
