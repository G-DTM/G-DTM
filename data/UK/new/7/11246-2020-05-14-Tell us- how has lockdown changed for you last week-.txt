Tell us: how has lockdown changed for you last week?
We'd like to hear how the government's plan to ease the lockdown in England has affected you. What changes have you seen in Scotland and Wales?
As part of the government's plan to ease the lockdown, people in England can return to their workplace if they cannot work from home. They have been asked to avoid public transport when possible and walk or cycle instead. People can now also take unlimited exercise and meet someone from another household, as long is it's outdoors.
A new "Stay alert" has replaced the "Stay home" slogan.
Meanwhile the Scottish government is promoting a new slogan: "Please continue to #StayAtHome. By staying at home, you are saving lives." Lockdown has been extended to 28 May, though the once a day outdoor exercise limit has been lifted.
The Welsh government continues to urge people to "stay at home" and is allowing people to exercise outside more than once. In Northern Ireland has also rejected Boris Johnson's messaging and is also adopting a more cautious approach.
We'd like to hear how the new rules have affected you this week. Perhaps you have been enjoying more time outside, or caught up with someone you've missed. If you live in England are you preparing to return to work? How do you feel about it? What changes have you seen when you've been outside this week?
