UK reports Europe's worst Covid-19 death toll: Politics Weekly podcast
Heather Stewart and Kate Proctor discuss a particularly bad week for Boris Johnson's government. Plus Frances Perraudin reports on how the response of devolved governments in the UK to Covid-19 might affect the future of the union
Heather Stewart steps back in front of the mic.
On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics published data which showed that the number of people who have died from Covid-19 in the UK is now more than 32,000 â€“ meaning it has overtaken Italy as the worst-hit European country.

Heather is joined by Kate Proctor to digest the week's news.
Plus, Frances Perraudin looks at how the response to Covid-19 might affect the future of the union, given that the four-nation approach that Johnson has urged for is seemingly slipping from his grasp.
