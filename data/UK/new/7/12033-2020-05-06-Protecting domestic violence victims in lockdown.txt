Protecting domestic violence victims in lockdown
Kate, a call handler for a domestic violence charity, discusses the challenges of trying to deal with the rising number of calls during lockdown. Guardian reporter Helen Pidd has been reporting on the domestic violence cases being heard at Manchester magistrates court over the past few weeks
Rachel Humphreys talks to Kate, a call handler with domestic violence charity Solace. Since lockdown began, calls to helplines like this one have risen by 25%. The Counting Dead Women project recorded 16 killings of women and children in the first three weeks of lockdown - where they'd usually expect about five.
Rachel also talks to the Guardian's North of England editor, Helen Pidd, who last month listened in on court four at Manchester magistrates court to hear how lockdown was changing the way domestic violence cases are being prosecuted. We also hear from David Philpott from Olliers Solicitors who has been working at the court for over 30 years.
If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic abuse, you can call the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Helpline on 0808 2000 247.
Solace has also increased their call capacity during this time for those in London. You can call their north and east London line on 0808 802 5565. The Women and Girls Network covers south and west London on 0808 801 0660.
