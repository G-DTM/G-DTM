Scottish lockdown will continue next week, Sturgeon tells Johnson
In recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.
Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the1918 influenza pandemicthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.
How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.
Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?
This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a suddenresurgence in infectionsdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.
Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged incramped dormitory accommodationused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.
Singapore's experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.
In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.
What are experts worried about?
Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.
However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says "'Second wave' isn't a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn't gone away, it's in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases."
The overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.
In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that witha vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.

Nicola Sturgeon says there are concerns about unrest if England relaxes rules sooner
Nicola Sturgeon has said she could agree to the slight easing of Scotland's lockdown from Monday but has rejected any significant relaxation of the rules.
The first minister said on Thursday the only relaxation she would consider would be allowing people to exercise outdoors more than once a day from next week, but only if the scientific advice justified it.
She said there were concerns about public unrest in Scotland if Boris Johnson decided to relax England's lockdown rules more quickly, after reports that ministers in London were considering allowing people to play golf, take picnics, take unlimited exercise and visit outdoor cafes from next week.
Speaking after Sturgeon had a teleconference with the prime minister and other devolved leaders on Thursday afternoon, Sturgeon's spokesman said she told Johnson that the Scottish lockdown would remain in force next week."The only issue under consideration at this time was in relation to outdoor exercise," her spokesman said. "The first minister also made clear that the 'stay at home' message remained crucial."Despite criticism from both Edinburgh and Cardiff that he had failed to consult them about his plans to relax the lockdown from Monday, Johnson did not share any details of his plans in Thursday's call but he indicated he would host another teleconference this weekend, before an expected Cobra meeting on Sunday.
Downing Street said the prime minister emphasised his commitment to collaborative working with the devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont and also insisted he had no intention of risking a fresh surge in Covid-19 infections by relaxing the lockdown too far or too soon.
However, Downing Street hinted Johnson was happy for the lockdown to be relaxed at different paces in different parts of the UK.
"He reiterated his commitment to continuing our UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus, even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds. Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation," a No 10 spokeswoman said. "They all agreed that continued engagement between our administrations is vital and to remain in close contact in the days and weeks ahead."
Sturgeon said her government was "constantly" talking to Police Scotland about public order. The force has said its data shows a high level of compliance with the lockdown, but by late April 78 people had been arrested and there had been more than 7,800 alleged breaches.
"As these messages over time become more nuanced, then the issues around enforcement become, potentially, much more difficult," Sturgeon said.
She said she was opposed to any significant easing of the lockdown rules, and warned against the UK's devolved governments being pressured into adopting lighter regulations before it was safe to do so.
She said it seemed that Scotland's current rate of community transmission, the so-called R number, was hovering around 1. She said Scotland was still a few weeks behind England in the infection curve. That needed to be far lower before the regulations were greatly eased, she said.
"Any significant easing up of restrictions at this stage could be very, very risky indeed," she said. "All that tells me is that extreme caution is required at this critical juncture."

While another 59 people died in hospital in Scotland over the last 24 hours, the numbers in hospital fell again, by 45 to 1,587, and the numbers in intensive care were also down, by three to 86. Sturgeon said Scotland was at a "pivotal point" and the worst result of any easing would be cases surging again.
Sturgeon's cautious approach was backed by Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, on a visit to Scotland. Starmer said it was essential that all four parts of the UK took the same approach.
"Having different approaches and rival strategies isn't going to help. I'm not talking about [more cautious nations having] a veto but my strong preference is that the whole of the UK move as one on this," he said. "The danger if we don't act together is that there are then different rules for different places, that makes it much more difficult to police."
Starmer said it was "very hard to see how you could have separate regimes in different countries or regions".﻿
