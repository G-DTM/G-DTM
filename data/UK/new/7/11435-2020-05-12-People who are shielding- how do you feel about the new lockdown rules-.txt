People who are shielding: how do you feel about the new lockdown rules?
As restrictions ease for people who are not subject to health conditions, do you feel forgotten about, isolated or cut off?
The UK government has set out its plan to leave lockdown, but the changes will not affect everyone equally. While some people are going back to work and others are looking forward to exercising more and meeting up with friends and members of their families, the restrictions are staying the same for high risk people who have been shielding. The advice is staying the same: stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact.
If you are at home – and facing the prospect of staying there beyond the end of June – we want to hear from you. Do you agree with the government's plan? Do you think it is fair? Are the new rules putting you at greater risk? Do you feel as if the gap between you and other people is widening? Should the government have come up with a fairer system so you could also be given more time outside and more freedom? More broadly, how have you been over the last few months? Should the government have done more for you?
