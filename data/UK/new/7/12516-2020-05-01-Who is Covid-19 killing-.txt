Who is Covid-19 killing?
More than 26,000 people in the UK have officially been recorded as having died from the coronavirus. In this episode we look beyond the headline figure at who is dying â€“ and hear from friends and family about the lives cut short
Britain's official death toll from the coronavirus this year is now more than 26,000. Behind that statistic are lives tragically cut short.
In today's episode, Anushka Asthana looks beyond that headline figure to find out who is dying from Covid-19, and which groups are disproportionately affected.
She hears from the author James Morton who knew Leonard "Nipper" Read, the police officer who was responsible for bringing down the Kray twins in the 1960s. He died of Covid-19 after contracting it in hospital at the age of 95.
She also hears from Nazir Afzal about his brother  Umar, who died at home aged 71 and subsequently tested positive for the virus. Umar Afzal is one of a disproportionate number of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds to die of Covid-19, the subject of a new government official inquiry.
Another is Mervyn "Mally" Kennedy, a bus driver in London, who died at 67. His daughter Penny Palmer pays tribute to him.
Finally, Sarah Bredin Kemp tells us about the amazing life of her best friend the 29-year-old nurse Rebecca Mack.
