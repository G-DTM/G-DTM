Blind Date takeover: looking for love in lockdown - part 2
In the concluding part of our Blind Date takeover, two more couples meet remotely for a socially distanced evening of drinks and dinner
In part 1 of our Blind Date takeover last week, three couples met up via Zoom and let us listen in to what a first date sounds like in the age of lockdowns. This week Rachel Humphreys hears how it went for two more couples.
First up are Mally and Butho, who sit down to dinner, one in Glasgow, the other in Edinburgh. Later on amid a dramatic thunderstorm, Deej, who is in isolation in Kathmandu, Nepal, dials in to Naomi in east London.
