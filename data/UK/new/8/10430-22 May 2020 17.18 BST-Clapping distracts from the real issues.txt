Clapping distracts from the real issues
NHS psychiatrist Dr Sophie Behrman responds to an article from a doctor who says they've had enough of people clapping for them
I fully support my anonymous colleague's sentiments (I'm an NHS doctor – and I've had enough of people clapping for me, 21 May). Not only does the clapping and love-thy-keyworker-neighbour mentality distract from urgent, thorny issues (eg PPE, undervalued immigrant staff); it may also damage those key workers' psychological wellbeing. As an NHS psychiatrist, I am aware of medical colleagues feeling guilty for not being able to do enough. No one feels like a hero, and no one wants to go to war. When bombarded with warfare rhetoric and imagery of heroic doctors bravely fighting on the frontline, individual doctors who feel scared and impotent begin to feel like failures.
Why do people clap? Because it is not just doctors who feel guilty. "Civilians" are dutifully "staying home" and "staying alert", but perhaps also feeling guilty that they cannot do more. Clapping alleviates that guilt as it's "for the NHS". Perhaps for a moment we can believe that clapping will ward coronavirus away from our door. Clapping fosters community spirit and creativity. It punctuates an otherwise tedious passage of days leading to eternity. Clap on. Clap for yourself. Clap for your neighbours, and shout about what needs to change. But take the spotlight off the key workers now.Dr Sophie BehrmanOxfordJoin the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.comRead more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
