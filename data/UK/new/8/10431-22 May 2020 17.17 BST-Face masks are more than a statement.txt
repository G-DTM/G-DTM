Face masks are more than a statement
Simon Kolstoe says "My feeling is that this [face-mask use] is becoming more of a statement â€¦ of solidarity" (Covid-19: face mask rules more political than scientific, says UK expert, 21 May). His feeling is a preconception. We need science from university lecturers, not feelings. A fabric face mask will not stop all the droplets from a sneeze or cough. But it will stop some, and a well-fitted one will stop most.Hilary CashmanNorton, County Durham
Based on my experience in the Czech Republic, the first country in Europe to mandate masks in public, I strongly disagree with Dr Kolstoe, who believes it doesn't do any particular good to wear masks. The minor discomfort is a reminder of the danger of infection and reinforces my need to also practise social distancing and other safe behaviours.
The impacts of wearing a mask on a society's acceptance of the full range of public health measures should not be ignored. The vast majority of the population's adherence to the Czech government's Covid-19 strategy has resulted in a low number of deaths (306 as of 21 May) and the planned expiry of the requirement to always wear a mask outdoors on 25 May.Dave RiffelmacherPrague, Czech Republic
