Will millions of children really be returning to school in June?
Oli de Botton is a headteacher of a large state school in Newham, east London. Like many teachers across the country, he is tackling the daunting task of getting ready for the return of some of his students in early June. Sally Weale, the Guardian education correspondent, looks at the backlash against this drive to return some year groups to school
The government has said it wants children in nursery and reception and years 1 and 6 to begin a phased return to schools from early June, with other years following soon after, so primary children are in school for a month before the summer holidays, as long as the government's five tests for easing lockdown have been met. It could be the most significant step towards easing the lockdown so far - but it's been hugely controversial.
