Number of people with coronavirus in England remains stable, says ONS
Snapshot finds 137,000 had virus between 4-17 May, slightly down from previous fortnight
The number of people with coronavirus in England has remained stable since the end of April, according to new data, with nearly 140,000 people infected in the last two weeks.
The second snapshot of Covid-19 rates in the community, taken by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), found that 137,000 people – 0.25% of the population – had coronavirus at any given time during the two weeks from 4-17 May.
The previous set of figures showed 148,000 were infected in England between 27 April and 10 May, but the ONS said "the change is relatively small and it should be interpreted that the number of people in England that have Covid-19 is relatively stable".
The study found there were an estimated 61,000 new Covid-19 infections per week in England over the past four weeks (26 April to 17 May), an incidence rate of 0.11 new cases per 100 people living in private-residential households.
The survey tested 14,599 people in 7,054 households, of whom 35 individuals in 32 households tested positive. The figures do not include people staying in hospital or care homes, where infections are likely to be higher.
The ONS found there were no differences in the rates of infection among men and women, or people of different ages. Between 4-17 May, 0.26% of women and 0.21% of men are estimated to have tested positive. The figures refer to infections reported in the community, and exclude those reported in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings.
The study also found there was no difference between the proportion of those testing positive for coronavirus who worked as nurses, doctors and care workers, and those not working in these roles.
Of those working with patients in healthcare and those in social care roles, 0.24% tested positive for Covid-19, the same rate as those doing other jobs. The previous survey found people working in patient-facing roles had a much higher rate of infection, 1.33% compared with 0.22%.
