Who was the first person you met after lockdown restrictions eased?
Now that we're allowed to meet one friend or family member, outside and at a two-metre distance in England, who did you pick after weeks apart?
As part of its lockdown easing plan, the UK government said that individuals are allowed to meet with one other person not from their household outside and at a two-metre distance, in England. After eight weeks of being forbidden from socialising outside of the people you share a home with, last weekend people around the country met with family and friends in streets, parks and beaches around the country for a stroll or a sit.
We want to hear from you about how you chose your first person to meet with once the lockdown eased. Who was it? How did the reunion make you feel? What did you do? Who were you sharing a home with previously? What was it like to be separated from someone important to you for so long?
