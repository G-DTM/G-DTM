Are you reuniting with family or friends as lockdown eases?
As lockdown restrictions ease, we'd like to hear about your reunions
Are you reuniting with family or friends, if so, we'd like to hear from you.
Groups of up to six people will be able to meet outdoors in England, from Monday, and for many this will be the first occasion that family and friends can be reunited, after ten weeks in lockdown. People will be allowed to congregate in public spaces or private gardens as long as they maintain physical distancing.
The approach to lockdown easing is slightly different in Scotland – people from one household can now meet another household – with a maximum of eight people. Similarly in Wales, one household will be able to meet another household from Monday. In Northern Ireland groups of six people can already meet outdoors.
We would like to hear from people who are holding reunions with family or friends for the first time since lockdown began. Are you meeting a new grandchild for the first time? Or holding a barbecue for friends or family who you've only been able to catch up with on Zoom? Perhaps you're celebrating a birthday or another special event?
