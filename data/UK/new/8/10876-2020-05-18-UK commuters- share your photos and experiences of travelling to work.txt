UK commuters: share your photos and experiences of travelling to work
What it is like to travel to work at the moment? We'd like to hear from commuters about their journeys to work
Train companies will increase the number of services on Monday to reflect the easing of coronavirus travel restrictions in England.
In a bid to enable physical distancing, capacity will be reduced to as little as 10% of normal levels, and passengers are being urged to avoid non-essential travel. British Transport Police will have more officers at London stations in a bid to control crowds.
As part of a staged exit from lockdown, the UK government has encouraged those who cannot work from home to consider returning to their workplaces, but to walk or cycle as much as possible, or travel by car or motor bike. The Department for Transport has advised that anyone who needs to take public transport should wear face masks, keep their distance from fellow travellers and avoid rush hour if possible.
If you are able to capture them safely, we want to see photos and videos of your commute, and hear about your experience of travelling to work.
We'd also like to find out if you wear some sort of face covering while you're travelling.
What is your commute like at the moment? Are you able to cycle or walk to work, or are you driving? If you have to use public transport, are you able to maintain physical distancing? And do you feel safe travelling to work?
