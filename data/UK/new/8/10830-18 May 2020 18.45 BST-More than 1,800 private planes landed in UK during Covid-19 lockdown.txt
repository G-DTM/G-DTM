More than 1,800 private planes landed in UK during Covid-19 lockdown
Figure includes privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flights
At least 1,800 private aircraft landed in the UK during lockdown, official figures have shown, with no requirement for arriving passengers to provide contact details for purposes of tracking the spread of coronavirus.
In response to a question from the Conservative peer Baroness Anelay of St Johns, the Home Office said that between 17 March and 14 April, 1,812 private aircraft flights landed at airports in the UK.
The figure include privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flights. A breakdown was not provided.
In the written answer, the Home Office minister, Baroness Williams of Trafford, said: "There is no Public Health England requirement to record contact details for arriving or departing passengers for Covid-19 purposes."
The UK's border policy before and during the lockdown is facing increased scrutiny. The government previously revealed that just 273 out of the 18.1 million people who entered the UK in the three months prior to the coronavirus lockdown were formally quarantined.
Since 13 March, government policy has been to inform passengers arriving at the border of the measures in place in the UK through posters, screens and leaflets. There has been no enforced quarantine or thermal screening.
On 10 May, Boris Johnson said that air passengers arriving in the UK would soon be required to self-isolate. It is now understood that this will also apply to land and sea arrivals.
Experts have questioned the scientific basis behind introducing such a policy at this stage in the pandemic and the travel and tourism industry has warned of dire consequences for the sector if such a policy is pursued.
