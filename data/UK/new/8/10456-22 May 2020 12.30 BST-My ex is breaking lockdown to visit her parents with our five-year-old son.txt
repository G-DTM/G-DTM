My ex is breaking lockdown to visit her parents with our five-year-old son
This is a serious breach of trust, but I am wary of raising it because she is likely to react angrily and defensively and further damage our relationship
My ex-partner and I have a five-year-old son. Recently, I discovered that she has been breaking lockdown rules by taking him to visit her elderly parents.
I sympathise with anyone who needs family contact during the lockdown. I am sure we all feel the same way. But this is a serious breach of trust, as well as putting our son at risk.
We have not had a good relationship since separating, but I genuinely believed the lockdown had led to better communication and more cooperation. We have been moving our son safely between the two houses.
If I raise this with her, I am likely to get an angry and defensive reaction. The best approach might be just to let her carry on doing it and hope for the best, but that goes against my protective instinct as a parent. What should I do?
