Why did so many people die in care homes? That may be the most urgent question of the likely public inquiry into the UK's Covid-19 response. So far, 16,000 residents of care and nursing homes have died compared with fewer than 3,000 in Germany and none in Hong Kong.
The Guardian's social affairs correspondent, Rob Booth, tells Anushka Asthana that despite the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claiming the government "threw a protective ring" around care homes, government failures have led to thousands of deaths.
She also talks to Sarah Harrison, director of Bridgedale House care home and Anita Astell, owner of Wren Hall nursing home about the alternative arrangements they both felt forced to make once they realised that government guidance was not protecting their residents from Covid-19.
