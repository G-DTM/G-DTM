Everyone in Welsh care homes to be offered coronavirus tests
Move follows scientific advice and brings country in line with England, says health minister
Everyone in care homes in Wales will be able to get a coronavirus test, the Welsh government has said.
The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said the change follows the latest scientific advice and brings Wales in line with England. The move means every care home in Wales will have access to testing and be able to order online kits for residents and staff.
It comes as opposition politicians said the original decision not to test all residents and staff in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry.
Previously, only residents and staff in care homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus were tested, as were homes with more than 50 beds, anyone being discharged from hospital into a care home, or anyone moving into a care home from the community.
Gething said: "How we tackle coronavirus continually changes as we receive more emerging evidence and scientific advice. We have been very clear in our approach that our strategy is about reducing harm first and we will adapt policies in order to do this.
"Today is a step change in how we will be testing in care homes, adapting our policy so that every resident and member of staff can be tested for coronavirus. I hope this brings further reassurance to those living and working in care homes and their families."
Testing in Wales had been more restrictive than in England, where all care home residents and staff have been eligible for testing regardless of symptoms since the end of April.
The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said at the time there was not a "clinical value" in testing everyone where no one was displaying symptoms. The Office for National Statistics said there were 532 deaths up to 1 May involving Covid-19 among care home residents in Wales. This was the lowest regional total across England and Wales.
Janet Finch-Saunders, the shadow minister for social care, said: "Care homes have some of society's most vulnerable and for that reason I have been urging the Welsh government for weeks to extend coronavirus testing to cover all care home residents and staff.
"As I said at the time, expanding the testing in care homes can reduce the spread of Covid-19 among our most vulnerable and incredible staff.
"It is about time that my calls have been answered by the Welsh government, but it is shameful that the expansion could not have been implemented sooner given that capacity in testing is increasing."
Plaid's Delyth Jewell added: "This is a long-awaited recognition of what we have consistently argued for.
"The tragic cases of Covid-19 in care homes and its prevalence within them should have been a wakeup call for the Welsh government that testing everyone was a necessary life-saving step. The refusal to do so up to now should be the subject of examination in the future inquiry."
On Friday, the first minister announced Wales' plan to exit the coronavirus lockdown. The 20-page document has been described as a "traffic light roadmap", and details what restrictions will be eased through three stages â€“ red, amber and green.
Each of the stages will see a "cautious" lifting of measures that apply to schools, businesses and general freedoms. Unlike in England, the Welsh government has decided not to give any dates for when the country could expect the changes.
A further 18 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths there to 1,191, health officials said. Public Health Wales said a further 183 people had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 12,142.
