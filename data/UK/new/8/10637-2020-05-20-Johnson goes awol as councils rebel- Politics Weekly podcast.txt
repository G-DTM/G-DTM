Johnson goes awol as councils rebel: Politics Weekly podcast
Jonathan Freedland and Kate Proctor break down the latest news from Westminster, and Andy Burnham explains why this pandemic has proved the case for decentralisation of government
In a week when ministers admitted their long-awaited contact-tracing app wouldn't be ready for weeks, Jonathan Freedland and Kate Proctor ask: why does the government keeps setting itself targets it simply can't keep?
Plus, as devolved governments continue to go their own way with the Covid-19 response, regional mayors across England are calling for greater transparency on the impact the infection is having around the country.
Jonathan speaks to the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, about why the government has shown – through its London-centric approach to the pandemic – that it is unable to follow through on its promise to level up the country.
