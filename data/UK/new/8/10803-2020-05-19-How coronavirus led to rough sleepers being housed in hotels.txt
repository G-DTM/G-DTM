How coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels
Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales. It is part of an unprecedented emergency operation to get all rough sleepers off the streets
Anushka Asthana talks to Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman, who has been speaking to some of the more than 5,400 homeless people in England and Wales currently being housed in hotels at the government's expense. Clare Sutcliffe found the transition from sleeping in a doorway in Soho to a bed in a central London hotel disorienting, but after five weeks off the streets, her health has begun to improve.
It is part of an unprecedented emergency operation to get all rough sleepers off the streets, to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This hotel is one of almost 50 Travelodge, Ibis, Holiday Inn and smaller hotels in London (which were empty because of the disappearance of tourists and business travellers) that have been taken over by local authorities and charities. Amelia also discusses meeting rough sleepers who haven't been given shelter in a hotel.
