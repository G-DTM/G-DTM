Shielding in England: how do you feel about coming out of lockdown?
As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about it
From this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.
On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.
They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.
If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.
