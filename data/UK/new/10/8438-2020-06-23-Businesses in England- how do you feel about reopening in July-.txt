Businesses in England: how do you feel about reopening in July?
If you will be returning to work in places such as museums or hairdressers, we would like to hear from you
Cinemas, museums, galleries, and pubs, restaurants and hairdressers in England will be allowed to return to work from 4 July.
Measures such as limiting numbers of people and one-way systems are expected to be implemented in order to keep people safe.
We'd like to hear from employers and workers about how you're preparing to open and and how you feel about returning to work.
