Run a business that can't reopen? Tell us how you feel
Some businesses will be able to return next month, but others such as nightclubs and nail bars are not allowed. We would like to hear from you
Some businesses are able to reopen on 4 July but among those that have to remain closed in England include nail bars and beauty salons.
Indoor sites such as nightclubs and indoor play areas including swimming pools are categorised as "close proximity" venues, which the government deems too risky for now.
If you run or work in a business that is not allowed to reopen in July, we would like to hear from you. How do you feel about the government guidance? Are you still making preparations?
