England's independence day from lockdown: Politics Weekly podcast
Jonathan Freedland and Kate Proctor discuss Westminster's easing of lockdown, Peter Walker updates us on housing minister Robert Jenrick's troubles, and Miatta Fahnbulleh and Anoosh Chakelian discuss what's next for the UK economy after furlough
On 4 July people living in England will be welcomed back to popular establishments such as pubs, restaurants and hairdressers. Many have questioned the reasoning behind lifting some of the lockdown measures but not others. Why is this government, which has been plagued with U-turns throughout this pandemic, so confident its plan will work? Jonathan and Kate discuss.
As things heat up for Robert Jenrick, Peter Walker brings us up to date on the planning decision that has landed the housing minister in hot water.
Plus, the New Statesman's Britain editor, Anoosh Chakelian, and Miatta Fahnbulleh, the chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, discuss how Rishi Sunak should be preparing for the fallout after the job retention scheme ends in October.
