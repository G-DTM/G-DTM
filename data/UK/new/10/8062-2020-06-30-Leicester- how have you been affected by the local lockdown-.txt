Leicester: how have you been affected by the local lockdown?
We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting them
Leicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.
Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.
We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences. We're interested in hearing from those who are working directly with the pandemic, whether it's with the NHS or local test and trace. How do you feel about the local lockdown?
