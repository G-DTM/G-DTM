Christmas Covid rules: what are the new measures in England?
What do the restrictions mean for your Christmas bubble? What other rules are in place?
Boris Johnson announced a dramatic scaling back of the government's "Christmas bubble" plans and issued a new "stay at home" order covering London and much of the south and east of England in response to a new fast-spreading strain of coronavirus.
In London and the south-east, people must stay at home over Christmas and must not meet up with other households. One resident could meet up with another person for a walk, but not a whole household of people.
In the rest of England, the window for three households meeting to make a "Christmas bubble" will be reduced from a five-day window between 23 and 27 December to just Christmas Day.
A Christmas bubble can only meet in a private home, a place of worship or public outdoor spaces. You can't change the bubble, you must pick a further two households and only meet them on Christmas Day.
Travel restrictions across the whole of the UK will be lifted on Christmas Day to allow people to travel across the nations or between different tiers to meet those in their Christmas bubble – unless they live in a tier 4 area.
Students are considered to be part of their parents' Christmas bubble, and children under 18 whose parents do not live together may be part of both parents' Christmas bubbles. Between 23 and 27 December, people can continue to use a childcare bubble, but only if "reasonably necessary".
Existing support bubbles count as one household within the three-household limit.
People are advised to avoid crowds in the Boxing Day sale and not to gather in large groups to celebrate new year.
All of mainland Scotland will be placed into level 4 restrictions – the highest level – from Boxing Day and the restrictions will be reviewed after two weeks.
In Wales, lockdown will come into force from midnight on Saturday , while festive bubbles will only apply on Christmas Day.
