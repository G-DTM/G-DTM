Police issue warning against coronavirus fraudsters in UK
Fake emails and scams about outbreak already tricked British public out of £800,000
Fraudsters have been quick to latch on to the coronavirus outbreak, with fake "Centers for Disease Control" emails and other scams already tricking the UK public out of £800,000, according to the police.
The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) on Friday issued an urgent scam warning after identifying 21 cases of fraud involving coronavirus in February.
Ten of the frauds involved desperate buyers of face masks, with one person paying £15,000 for masks that were never delivered.
Other frauds involve emails and texts purporting to be from research organisations affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.
The NFIB said: "They claim to be able to provide the recipient with a list of coronavirus infected people in their area. In order to access this information, the victim needs to click on a link, which leads to a malicious website, or is asked to make a payment in bitcoin."
It added that it expected to receive many more reports of fraud as the coronavirus spread globally.
The advice to consumers is not to click on links or attachments in suspicious emails, and never respond to unsolicited messages and calls that ask for personal or financial details.
Individuals can report fraud or cybercrime to Action Fraud any time using its online reporting tool at actionfraud.police.uk.
