Football and Covid-19, plus Ultras and the Champions League – Football Weekly Extra
Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and James Montague discuss football's response to Covid-19, European departures for Liverpool and Tottenham, PSG players' life choices and lifting the lid on Ultras
Join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.
We start by discussing football's response to the ongoing and developing Covid-19 pandemic, with footballers and staff testing positive and leagues postponing, suspending or cancelling play altogether.
Liverpool and Tottenham both went out of the Champions League this week – we discuss how significant this will be for each side.
In part three we talk to James about his new book, 1312: Among the Ultras, and the experiences he had in the course of learning more about these secretive and powerful fan groups.
Back on Monday.
