The secretive scientific committee guiding Britain's coronavirus response
Following the revelation that Boris Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, took part in the key scientific committee meetings tasked with providing independent advice, Anushka Asthana hears from the Observer's Sonia Sodha and the former chief scientist Sir David King
The government has said at every step of its response to the Covid-19 crisis that it is "following the science". But the expert group of scientists advising the government (Sage) has been shrouded in secrecy: the minutes of meetings, those in attendance and the evidence considered are rarely published. Last week, the Guardian revealed that Boris Johnson's chief political adviser was participating in Sage meetings â€“ something apparently without precedent.
So who is actually advising the government and why has it been so reluctant to be transparent about the advice it has been getting? Anushka Asthana hears from the Observer's chief leader writer, Sonia Sodha, and the former government chief scientist Sir David King.
