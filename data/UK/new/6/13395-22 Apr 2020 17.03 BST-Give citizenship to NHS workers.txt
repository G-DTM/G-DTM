Give citizenship to NHS workers
The wife of a consultant oncologist is afraid every day he goes to work, and calls for non-British citizens working in the NHS to be granted automatic citizenship
I'm an immigrant, with my husband working as a consultant oncologist for the NHS. Leaving South Africa two years ago was not an easy decision, but after falling victim to crime on a few occasions, ultimately a lifesaving one.
I have become fearful every day he goes to work and losing my husband would be devastating. Both my daughter and I are resident in the UK on dependency visas tethered to my husband's tier 2 work visa. Without him, we would be forced to return to South Africa. We have nothing left there, and to start again, with the inherent dangers, would be unimaginable.
My husband risks his life to save the lives of UK citizens. He does this willingly, with commitment and care, but the fear we have is real. A petition has been set up at tinyurl.com/NHScitizens asking for non-British citizens who are NHS workers to be granted automatic citizenship. I hope that people will recognise the tireless efforts being made by people like my husband and the great risks our families are facing. We are a part of this nation in spirit, if not by law. I hope the latter can change.Shivashni VeersamyDidcot, Oxfordshire
