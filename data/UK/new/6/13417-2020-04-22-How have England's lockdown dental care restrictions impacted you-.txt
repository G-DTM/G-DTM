How have England's lockdown dental care restrictions impacted you?
With face to face dental appointments suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic in England, we'd like to know about your access to dental care
Dental services in England have radically changed, with the government ending face to face appointments and launching regional hubs for urgent dental care. However, the Chief Dental Officer in England has acknowledged that some patients may have to travel up to an hour to reach their local hub, and dentists have expressed concerns about a lack of personal protective equipment.
We want to know about your access to dental care during lockdown. Perhaps you've had important appointments cancelled, or are having to adopt new care routines to look after your teeth. Maybe you live far away from your regional hub, and can't get the help you need.
If you're a dentist, we'd like to hear about how you're supporting patients remotely, and what your experience with dental care in lockdown has been.
