Should the UK bail out Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic?
Guardian wealth correspondent Rupert Neate looks at why billionaire Sir Richard Branson is asking the UK government to give his Virgin Atlantic airline a Â£500m bailout to help it survive the economic fallout of the lockdown
The billionaire Sir Richard Branson, who founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984 and retains a 51% stake alongside US airline Delta with 49%, is pleading for UK government support. But the plea has prompted a substantial backlash, with many pointing out that the entrepreneur has paid the exchequer no personal income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago.
The Guardian wealth correspondent, Rupert Neate, tells Anushka Asthana about the founding of Virgin Atlantic and why, along with many other airlines, it finds itself in such financial peril. Rupert says that if the company is unable to secure financial help, it may go bust.
