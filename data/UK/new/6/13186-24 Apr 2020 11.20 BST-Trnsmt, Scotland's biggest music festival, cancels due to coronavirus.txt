Coronavirus and culture – a list of major cancellations
Trnsmt, Scotland's biggest music festival, has cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. In a statement, organisers said they were '"absolutely gutted" but were taking the decision in light of the announcement by Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon that social distancing measures could be in place for the rest of the year and possibly beyond.
Organisers said: "We are now working hard with all the artist teams to try and get the 2021 lineup as close to this year's as we can … Stay at home, practise social distancing and stay safe."
The festival, attended by 50,000 people a day for three days every July, was due to host Lewis Capaldi, Liam Gallagher and the Courteeners as headliners. It began in 2017, replacing T in the Park and using a new Glasgow city centre location.
Ticket holders will be able to request refunds or keep their tickets for the 2021 edition, scheduled for 9-11 July.
Given the comments made by Sturgeon, in tandem with the UK government's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, who also anticipates social distancing measures throughout 2020, it is unlikely that any music festivals will take place this summer. Major UK events such as Glastonbury and Download have already been cancelled, along with other arts events including the Hay and Edinburgh festivals. Another major Scottish festival, Belladrum, has said it is "looking more likely as time progresses" that it will cancel.
Large-scale festivals that have not yet cancelled include Reading and Leeds, Wireless and Creamfields.
