Government says booking system relies on public honesty rather than employment checks
No checks will be made on whether those requesting coronavirus tests are genuinely essential workers, the government has admitted, after demand for home kits ran out in two minutes and appointments for drive-through tests were filled within three hours.
Ministers said they were trusting the public to be honest about applying for essential worker tests. This leaves the system open to abuse, with one man who successfully applied for a drive-in test minutes after the scheme opened saying "any Tom, Dick or Harry" can get a test. The government insisted there was no evidence that high demand for tests was linked to fraudulent applications.
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, promised on Thursday that up to 10 million essential workers and their families would be able to apply for a drive-in test or home-testing kit from 6am on Friday. Within two minutes, all the 5,000 available kits had been ordered.
The government was forced to apologise after high demand for the drive-through appointments ran out before 8.30am. There was also a "technical problem" with the government website shortly after 8am.
The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said during the daily press conference later that 16,000 testing slots had been booked on Friday and dismissed suggestions that the website allowing critical workers to book tests had crashed: "We've seen in the last few days this difference between the capacity available (I think the last figure I saw was 51,000) and the number of tests done (28,000 yesterday), and how important it is to make sure we're using that available capacity, people being able to book online directly – that's all the critical workers, 10.72 million people with their families, are those who are able now to use that site.
"I can tell you, 16,000 of those [tests] were booked during the first period of that being online and the site has actually been brought back up around now for more people to go and book tests. It will then close off again, more tests will become available tomorrow and so on."
But it will be impossible to gauge whether only essential workers will benefit, as Hancock promised. Applications for a fresh batch of kits and drive-through appointments will reopen at 8am on Saturday.
A spokesman said the government was relying on the public to be honest.
"As with many aspects of the coronavirus response, we would expect the public to respond in good faith and that is what they have done with other aspects of the scheme and I think we would expect it to be the same here," he said.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: "It is a good thing that demand has been high and that 20,000 additional people are going to get a test. There is no evidence that the high demand is linked to people pretending to be key workers."
The problems with the website took the gloss off Hancock's launch of the self-referral system, which he said was "critical" to increasing testing.
One man whose wife is a primary school teacher expressed concern that no employer details were required in the application process. The man, who did not want to be named, said: "There was no requirement to put in my wife's employers' details. All she had to do was just choose a sector she was in and put in her name [and] date of birth."
The couple, who applied just after 6am, were given an appointment for a drive-through test at a lorry park in Portsmouth later on Friday.
He said: "She is going to take her school ID just in case, but it doesn't ask for that, so anybody could be doing this – it's just open to any Tom, Dick or Harry."
A medical engineer from north-west England who had developed a cough said he successfully booked a test but could not take it up because he did not own a vehicle.
"If I've got Covid-19 I don't want to ask someone to drive me there," he said. "So at the moment if you don't have a car you can't get a test. And there was no way of cancelling the test that they set aside for me, so they can't make it available for someone else."

Hancock said he was still confident the government would meet his target of 100,000 tests a day by next Thursday. "The reason that the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month was because we've been building these systems to automate the testing, automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed. So we're ahead of the plan, but you know, many a slip between cup and lip."
Shapps said getting "somewhere near" the 100,000 tests a day target would be an achievement by international standards. "I think that if by the end of the next week, the end of the month, we've got somewhere near that goal of 100,000, I think in comparative terms internationally I think that's a very high number." He said there were now 31 regional drive-through sites for testing.
The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said that questions needed answering as to "what mechanisms are in place to ensure everyone who needs a test gets one quickly, and whether a workable tracing strategy is being prepared."
