Share your experiences of expanded coronavirus testing in England
If you have applied or been offered an appointment we'd like to hear from you
All essential workers in England and their families will be able to book an appointment for a coronavirus test from Friday.
We would like to hear from you about your experiences. Did you find it easy to apply and have you been given a date for a test? Where will it take place? Were you told that applications had closed or that home test kits were unavailable? Are you concerned about passing on private details, including phone numbers, to the government?
