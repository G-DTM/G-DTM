Guardian Public Service Awards 2020 - on hold
Owing to the coronavirus pandemic, this year's awards are on hold. Further details in due course
The Guardian has decided to put its 2020 Public Service Awards on hold.
For the past 16 years, these awards have recognised and celebrated the dedication of staff at the core of the best public services in the UK.
Those values are in evidence the length and breadth of the country at the present time. With everyone in public service working flat out to combat the pandemic and support citizens, the Guardian Public Service Awards 2020 are now on hold.
More details will be given as soon as practicable.
