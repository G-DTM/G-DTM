Do you live in Plymouth and have a story to tell about coronavirus?
If you live in Plymouth, we'd like you to tell us about issues and experiences you feel are being overlooked during the Covid-19 outbreak. Share your stories
Anywhere But Westminster's Life in Lockdown series is aiming to build a film about the Covid-19 crisis around life in a single city, and we've chosen the Ocean City: Plymouth.
We know the city is a fascinating place, full of amazing community spirit and a sense of innovation. And we know that there are parts of Plymouth that reflect big themes of inequality and disadvantage, too often ignored. The city is also full of small businesses that will need help to get through this massively difficult period. We're already collecting video from some of the people who run the city, and some organisations doing amazing work to help people most affected. But we need to know a lot more. Do you live in Plymouth and have a story to tell about issues and experiences you feel are overlooked? Are you involved in an organised effort to make sure no one is isolated or ignored? Are you going to work during the crisis, in the public or private sector, and open to telling your story?
Here's the last episode of Anywhere but Westminster:
If you fancy shooting video, it's hugely important that you observe the physical distancing rules. Record a video diary of what's happening to you, but also turn your phone or camera the other way round, and give us a sense of your immediate surroundings.
Shoot landscape rather than portrait. If you can send us video, you can email it or use an FTP service, such as WeTransfer.
If you want to send a video now, you can email us at anywhere.but.westminster@theguardian.com but if you want to get in touch with us then please share your details in our encrypted form below. Only the Guardian will see your responses.
