Have you deferred paying your mortgage or credit card debts?
One in nine households is taking a mortgage holiday. If you are among that number and have concerns, let us know
When the coronavirus crisis hit, lenders in the UK were told to help their customers by allowing them to suspend payments of mortgages, credit cards and personal loans for three months.
Banks and building societies cannot charge fees, but will continue to add interest to the outstanding debts and that will need to be paid at a later date. So far, 1.2 million households have chosen to take a mortgage holiday, representing one in nine mortgage borrowers.
We would like to hear from you if you have chosen to take a payment holiday.
We're interested in finding out whether the process was straightforward and if you were offered any other options. Were you told how much it would cost in the long run? And was there anything that surprised you?
