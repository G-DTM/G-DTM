How the 5G conspiracy theories took hold
The Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson looks at why conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus have taken hold in the UK, with dozens of phone masts vandalised across the country over the past few weeks
Last week a mobile phone mast serving the emergency NHS Nightingale hospital in Birmingham was one of the latest targeted by arsonists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of coronavirus. False theories linking 5G to coronavirus have proliferated rapidly, leading to the vandalism of dozens of masts across the UK.
Guardian media editor Jim Waterson tells Rachel Humphreys why, despite lacking any scientific evidence, these theories have taken off, and how they have managed to spread so quickly.
