Share your thoughts on the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine
We'd like to hear from people in the UK about how they feel about the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine
The UK has licensed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid, allowing for mass immunisation with those most at risk being vaccinated next week.
The company has said the first doses of the vaccine will arrive in the next few days. The UK has bought 40m doses which has been shown to have 95% efficacy in its final trials.
We want to know how you feel about a vaccine being made available. We are particularly interested in hearing from people who have changed their mind over the last few months.
