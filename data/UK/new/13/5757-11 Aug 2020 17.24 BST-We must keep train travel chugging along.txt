We must keep train travel chugging along
Rail travel is one of the safest and greenest modes of transport, writes Alan Whitehouse, and preserving our national network must be a top priority
Catherine Shoard's piece (It would be a tragedy if coronavirus costs us the joys of train travel, 10 August) is a timely reminder of the benefits of travelling by rail, still the safest and surely the most civilised way we have yet devised of getting about.
It's a pity that the government's messages on this topic have not had the same clarity. Why it should be acceptable to travel by air, where passengers breathe filtered, partly recirculated air in an enclosed compartment, but not acceptable to travel by train is a complete mystery.
But solving it may be crucial to the future of the railway network. Urging people to stay away from public transport will harm the long-term goal of railways replacing roads as a safer and greener form of transport.
It's also a pity that you chose to illustrate this article with a picture from a heritage railway. Heritage railways have their part to play, and in some cases are major economic drivers in their local economy. But what matters now is the national network that used to get many more of us to work, school and on holiday. It is a priceless resource that needs protecting.Alan WhitehouseHon president, Yorkshire Railfuture
