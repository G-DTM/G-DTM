How Britain's deepest recession is becoming a jobs crisis
Economics writer Aditya Chakrabortty describes how the coronavirus crisis has sent Britain plunging into a record recession and what it means for the millions of people fearing for their jobs
Britain is officially in its deepest recession since records began following the unprecedented economic shutdown in response to the coronavirus crisis. It has left millions of people fearing for their futures and especially their employment. In the past six months, the UK has shed nearly 750,000 jobs.
Economics columnist Aditya Chakrabortty tells Mythili Rao that the chancellor's initial response of the government-backed furlough scheme was pivotal. But as Rishi Sunak looks to wind down the scheme by October it risks pitching people out of work just as the economy is beginning its recovery.
One of those whose period of furlough has led to a redundancy notice is Paul Fryett. He describes the day he found out the news and how he fears for his family's future as he re-enters a difficult jobs market and contends with the benefits system for the first time in his 30-year career.
