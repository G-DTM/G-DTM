How cancer care was sidelined in the fight against Covid-19
With NHS services consumed by the fight against Covid-19 in recent months, cancer care has been dealt a blow, with diagnoses and treatment delayed
When the UK went into lockdown in March, the NHS braced for what it knew would be one of the most challenging periods in its history. As wards were cleared, staff were redeployed to the fight against Covid-19 that risked overwhelming the health service. But amid the upheaval, patients with other deadly diseases had their treatments and diagnoses delayed.
The Guardian's health policy editor, Denis Campbell, tells Anushka Asthana that the impact of coronavirus has been particularly hard on cancer care in the UK. Thousands of cases have gone undiagnosed and the backlog of appointments exceeds 2 million.
Sherwin Hall is one of those who believes his prognosis is much worse due to delays related to Covid-19. He has been told that his aggressive cancer has left him with just months to live. The Guardian's Sarah Marsh tells Anushka that following a freedom of information request she found that more than half of NHS patients referred for imaging diagnostics are waiting six weeks or more.
