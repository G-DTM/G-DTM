Quiz: how well do you understand the UK's coronavirus lockdown restrictions?
With different regulations applying in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, test yourself on the current restrictions
After a University College London study recently suggested that confidence in understanding coronavirus lockdown restrictions varies greatly across the UK and has dropped significantly since the early days of the measures in March, we thought we'd test you on what you know. The regulations vary across the nations and regions of the UK, and yesterday the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced that a raft of relaxation measures intended in England were to be scrapped. So how many of the changes to the country's coronavirus guidelines have you taken in? Have a go at our quiz and seeâ€¦
