Before and after the start of England's second lockdown - in pictures
England began its second nationwide lockdown on 5 November. Before-and-after photographs reveal the impact of the first days of the four-week stay-at-home order in which all non-essential shops and venues have to close.
People have been told to "stay at home" where possible, but will be allowed to leave their homes for education, medical appointments, to shop for essential goods, and for work if they cannot work from home.
