Young people: share your experiences of living with coronavirus in the UK
We'd like to hear from 17 to 25-year-olds about their experiences of life under lockdown across the UK
As a second national lockdown gets underway in England we'd like to hear from young people across the UK about how they're finding life during the pandemic.
How do you feel about the restrictions â€“ and how easy are they to abide by? How are you finding social distancing? How do you keep friendships and relationships going? What's different and what hasn't changed?
For those of you who are in school, what's life like inside and outside the classroom? And for young people who're working, what's the employment situation like?
