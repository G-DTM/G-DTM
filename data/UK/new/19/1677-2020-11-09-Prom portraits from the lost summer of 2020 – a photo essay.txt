These portraits were taken in north London between June and August this year. With school proms cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Alys Tomlinson photographed her subjects, aged between 15 and 19, in the outfits they would have worn to prom. Many of them had their final exams cancelled and had nothing to mark this significant step in growing up and leaving school. The portraits represent a loss and longing, but also celebrate each teenager as an individual, navigating this strange and challenging time.
