Liverpool residents: share your experiences of mass testing
We want to hear from people living and working in the Liverpool region about their coronavirus experiences
A government plan to test large parts of the population for coronavirus launched in Liverpool on Friday. Part of Operation Moonshot, up to 500,000 people in the city will be tested to measure the feasibility of mass population screening across the country.
Whether you work in schools or businesses, particularly in hospitality, or are affected generally by the restrictions we want to hear your thoughts, especially on mass testing. We're also interested in hearing from those who are working directly with the pandemic, whether it's with the NHS or local test and protect.
