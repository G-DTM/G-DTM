UK Covid-19 daily death toll rises to 492 – highest since May
Official government coronavirus UK death toll since pandemic began is now 47,742
The UK death toll from coronavirus has risen by 492 – almost 100 more than the previous day's increase.
Wednesday's total of people who died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 was the highest since 19 May, when 500 deaths were reported, and was 24% higher than the 392 recorded on Tuesday. This is despite the fact that figures on Tuesdays are often larger because of a delay in reporting deaths over the weekend.
The government's official coronavirus death toll for the UK since the pandemic began is now 47,742. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show the number of deaths from Covid to be around 63,000.
Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, said: "Sadly we know that the trend in deaths will continue to rise over the next few weeks. As the new measures come into place it will take some time for the impact to be seen.
"We have all made sacrifices and they have helped to save many lives. Let's stick with it to keep our loved ones safe. The fewer people you see, the more you'll help stop the spread."
The government figures showed a further 25,177 people had tested positive, the second highest total after 21 October, when there were 26,688 positive results. Testing capacity has increased significantly since the first wave of the pandemic. Wednesday's number of new positive cases was 26% greater and more than 5,000 higher than the equivalent figure on Tuesday, which was 20,018.
There are 12,320 people in hospital with Covid-19, with 1,142 in hospital beds, according to the latest figures. The number of hospitalised patients was 19% greater and almost 2,000 higher than Tuesday's total.
