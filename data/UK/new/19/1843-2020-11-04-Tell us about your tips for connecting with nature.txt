Tell us about your tips for connecting with nature
We would like to hear your suggestions for connecting with the natural world during a pandemic
When the UK went into lockdown, and traffic noise gave way to birdsong, many of us looked at our home areas in a completely different way. That moment even spawned a meme: "nature is healing, we are the virus". We'd love to hear about the tips and tricks that helped you connect with the natural world, for a future special issue of G2, the Guardian's daily features section.
How did you build some green space into your day? Where did you go for your wildlife fix? Is there a secret to seeking out wild spaces in unlikely places, even if you live in an urban area? Did you find an indispensable app for identifying plants or trees?
