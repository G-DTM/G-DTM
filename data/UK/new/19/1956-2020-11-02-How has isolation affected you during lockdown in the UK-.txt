How has isolation affected you during lockdown in the UK?
We'd like to speak to people across the UK about how they have been affected by isolation under lockdown restrictions, and what has helped them to cope
As part of the second national lockdown which will be imposed in England on Thursday, people will be prevented meeting from other households except under specific circumstances.
We'd like to speak to people who live in England about any concerns they may have about isolation under a second lockdown, and how they plan to manage it.
We'd also like to hear from people in Wales about how they have coped with isolation during the country's firebreaker lockdown, and those in Scotland and Northern Ireland who are unable to meet other households indoors.
