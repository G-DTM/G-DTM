Follow Scotland's lead on Covid-secure care home visits
Application of the Scottish rules to England could save families from unimaginable anguish, writes Marion Shoard
The guidance on care home visits in England (Care home residents in England can receive visits, says Matt Hancock, 4 November) still falls short of that in Scotland. The English guidance says all residents should be allowed visits from family and friends in a Covid-secure way, but Scotland also sets out the frequency and duration expected of such visits. So long as the home has been Covid-free for 28 days, its visiting risk assessments have been approved by the local director of public health and its care workers are tested weekly, each resident can receive an indoor visit of up to four hours by one visitor and an outdoor visit of up to one hour by up to six people from no more than two households, weekly.
Scotland also insists that "essential visits" must continue whatever the level of infection, and in a far wider set of circumstances than allowed for in England (where only "end of life" has been specified). In Scotland these visits should take place if the resident's health is or may be deteriorating, and where visiting may help with communication difficulties or ease significant stress. Applying Scotland's rules in England could save families from unimaginable anguish. Marion Shoard Author, How to Handle Later Life
