Has your child had to self-isolate from a UK school because of coronavirus?
If your child has had to self-isolate after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid in a UK school or nursery, we'd like to hear from you
We'd really like to hear from you if your child has been asked to self-isolate for 14 days after coming into close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus at their school or nursery.
How did you explain what was happening to your child, particularly if they are very young? Tell us more about the experience: what was the impact of them of isolating from the outside world again, or knowing that they were considered a risk to other people? How willing was your child to return to their school or nursery afterwards and how did they feel about staff? How did you cope balancing work and sudden unexpected extra childcare? What support did you get from employers and from schools or nurseries?
We've heard from a number of parents about kids experiencing rolling self-isolation: how many times has your child been asked to stay at home since schools and childcare setting started up again?
