UK Covid death toll rises by nearly 400, bringing total to 47,250
Data reveals highest daily increase in deaths registered in five months while lab-confirmed cases go up by 20,018
A further 397 people have been reported as having died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, the highest daily increase in Covid-related deaths registered in five months.
While the Tuesday tally each week tends to be higher owing to a delay in reporting deaths over the weekend, the latest figure is nevertheless the highest recorded since 422 people were reported as having died on 27 May.
It is more than seven times the daily toll recorded on 23 March when the first national lockdown began, and takes the government's official coronavirus death toll for the UK since the pandemic began to 47,250.
However, separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been just under 63,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK.
The government said that, as of 9am on Tuesday, there had been a further 20,018 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases to 1,073,882.
On Thursday, new national lockdown restrictions are due to come into effect across England and will last for at least four weeks in a bid to curb the resurgent spread of the virus.
Under the new rules, people will be asked to stay at home as much as possible, unless for specific reasons including work and education. Households will not be allowed to mix indoors or in private gardens unless they are in each other's support bubble, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops must close.
Data on patients with Covid-19 is not comparable across the UK due to differences in the way the figures are reported.
Separate government figures showed there were 10,377 patients with Covid-19 in hospital in England on Tuesday, up from 8,171 a week ago, while 952 were in ventilation beds, up from 742 a week ago.
A total of 1,280 patients with confirmed Covid-19 were admitted to hospitals in England on Sunday, the latest figure available, compared with 1,186 a week earlier.
Meanwhile, in Scotland, 1,225 patients were in hospital with Covid-19 as of Monday, up from 1,052 a week earlier, with 93 in ventilation beds, up from 90 a week earlier.
In Wales, the number of patients with Covid-19 in hospital reached 866 as of Monday, up from 654 a week earlier, with 57 in ventilation beds, up from 51 a week earlier.
In Northern Ireland, 379 patients with Covid-19 were in hospital as of Sunday, down from 431 a week earlier, with 42 in ventilation beds as of Monday, up from 30 a week earlier.
