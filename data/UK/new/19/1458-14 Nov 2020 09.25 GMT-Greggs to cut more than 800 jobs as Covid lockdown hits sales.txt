Greggs to cut more than 800 jobs as Covid lockdown hits sales
Bakery chain's CEO says business will not be profitable if weak sales continue
Greggs has announced plans to cut more than 800 jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
The chief executive of the bakery chain said it "will not be profitable as a business" if sales stay at the levels seen during lockdown, as it was confirmed that 820 staff would lose their jobs.
In a statement posted on the Greggs employee information website earlier this week, Roger Whiteside said: "Covid trading conditions have forced this action on to our business, and we are all very saddened by the need to part company with around 820 friends and colleagues, many of whom have worked with us for many years."
He went on to say that "the battle with Covid hasn't gone away, and is intensifying further", with lockdown measures in place across the four nations of the UK.
Whiteside added: "At lockdown levels of sales, even after all of the mitigating action that we have taken, Greggs will not be profitable as a business and there can be no room for complacency."
At the end of September, the Newcastle-based chain said it was in talks with staff to cut hours to try to minimise job losses when the furlough scheme was expected to end in October.
Whiteside told reporters at the time: "Some stores have staff hours which are just off what's needed for current demand. But others are a long way off and will need significant change."
