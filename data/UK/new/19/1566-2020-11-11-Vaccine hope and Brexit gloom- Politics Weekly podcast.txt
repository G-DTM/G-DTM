Vaccine hope and Brexit gloom: Politics Weekly podcast
Heather Stewart, Simon Murphy and Lisa O'Carroll recap a busy week in Westminster. Libby Brooks, Steven Morris and Rory Carroll update us on how the devolved nations have approached the second wave. Plus, Rajeev Syal speaks to the chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon.
The government has had a so-so week. The good news is that there is hope that a Covid-19 vaccine will be available soon. The bad news is that we're rapidly running out of time to get a Brexit deal sorted with the EU. Members of the House of Lords were clear in their disdain for a clause in the government's internal market bill which would see them break international law over the Northern Irish protocol. Now that we know Joe Biden – a fan of the Good Friday agreement – is heading for the White House, what can we expect in the next few months?
And as people in England finish their first week in their second lockdown, people in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have some restrictions lifted. Later on I talk to my colleagues around the UK about the various approaches to Covid-19 by the devolved nations.
Plus, Rajeev Syal speaks to the chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon.
