Twitter permanently suspends conspiracy theorist David Icke's account
Social media platform said Icke had violated its rules regarding coronavirus misinformation
Twitter has permanently suspended the account of the conspiracy theorist David Icke.
A spokesman for the social media platform said Icke had violated its rules regarding coronavirus misinformation.
The move follows the decision by YouTube and Facebook to terminate Icke's accounts in early May for the same reason.
The former footballer, 68, has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it is linked to the rollout of the 5G mobile network.
Famous medics including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms.
They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which claims his conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30m times.
CCDH had called for Twitter and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, to permanently ban Icke and his content from their platforms.
The Countdown presenter Rachel Riley celebrated Icke's departure from the the popular website, tweeting: "The UK's foremost hate peddler/conspiracy grifter has finally been chucked off Twitter."
Icke's Instagram page, which has 212,000 followers, is still active and posted a video on the weekend of him telling a large crowd in Birmingham to "choose freedom". The video has been viewed more than 85,000 times.
