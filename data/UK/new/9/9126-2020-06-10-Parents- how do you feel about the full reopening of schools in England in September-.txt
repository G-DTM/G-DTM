Parents: how do you feel about the full reopening of schools in England in September?
We'd like to hear from parents and teachers about the government's announcement that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full at the start of the next academic year
The government have today announced that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full in September.
Current limitations on the number of students that can be in school at once will be lifted, but schools will be expected to keep children in 'bubbles' according to their class or year group. Older children will also be 'encouraged' to keep their distance from their peers and staff, and measures such as regular cleaning and hand-washing will also be in place.
We would like to hear from teachers and parents of school children about how they feel about today's announcement.
How is your school preparing for children to return? Do you have any concerns? If you are a parent, how do you and your children feel about going back to school?
