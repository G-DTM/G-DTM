Maps show UK pavements not wide enough for social distancing - in pictures
Spatial analysis by Esri UK has found that most pavements around the country are less than 3 metres wide, making it difficult for pedestrians to remain 2 metres apart and follow government guidelines for social distancing. Using measurements from Ordnance Survey, Esri UK has created a map of all pavement widths, discovering that only 30% of Great Britain's pavements are at least 3 metres wide, 36% are between 2 and 3 metres and 34% are less than 2 metres wide. Maps were created to help local authorities make walking safer for the public
