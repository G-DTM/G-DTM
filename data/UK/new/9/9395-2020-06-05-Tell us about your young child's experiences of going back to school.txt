Tell us about your young child's experiences of going back to school
Is yours experiencing fears around cleanliness or difficulties socialising with other children? We'd like to hear from you
After months at home during lockdown, many toddlers or early years children have returned to school in England. In Wales, schools reopen on 29 June and in Scotland teachers can return to prepare forthe start of the new school year on 11 August.
Having remained with family or carers for so long, and taught to avoid those outside their household, the return to school might be confusing for some young children.
We'd like to hear from parents or carers about their experience of supporting a toddler or young child during lockdown, particularly around the return to school.
Perhaps your child has had trouble being separated from parents or carers after so long together, experienced fears around cleanliness, or difficulties in their relationship to those outside of their household.
