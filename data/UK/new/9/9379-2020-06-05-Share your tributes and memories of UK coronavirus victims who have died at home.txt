We would like you to share your tributes for friends and family who have died in their own homes
According to the office for national statistics, so far this year 1,991 deaths involving coronavirus occurred in private homes, almostquadruple the number in hospices.
We would like you to share your memories and tributes for those who have died at home from Covid-19.
Did your friend or relative choose to stay at home? Did they have concerns about going into hospital? We would also like to hear from people whose loved ones were already on a palliative end-of-life plan.
