England is easing out of lockdown â€“ is it safe?
Health officials and even government scientists have warned against the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, saying it could lead to a surge in infections. David Hunter, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford, looks at the risks
Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more. This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not fall precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.
Those restrictions have meant the R0 now appears to be below 1.0 in the UK, and on Monday the government eased some of the lockdown rules, allowing people to meet outside in groups of up to six, outdoor markets and car showrooms to begin operating again, and schools to reopen. But is it actually safe? David Hunter, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, talks to Rachel Humphreys about the risks involved in lifting lockdown too early.
