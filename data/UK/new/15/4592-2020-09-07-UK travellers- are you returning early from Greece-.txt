UK travellers: are you returning early from Greece?
We would like to hear from those returning from parts of Greece about travel arrangements and how you will manage quarantine
Have you had to change travel plans to avoid quarantine?
UK transport secretary Grant Schapps has announced that from 4am on Wednesday quarantine will be imposed on arrivals to England from seven Greek islands: Lesvos, Tinos, Serifos, Mykonos, Crete, Santorini and Zakynthos.
Holidaymakers in Portugal face a 14 day quarantine when returning to Scotland and Wales as coronavirus cases reached levels considered dangerous by the UK government. In Scotland, travellers from Greece already have to quarantine, whereas in Wales, this only applies to those arriving from a number of Greek destinations including the island of Zante.
There is no requirement for English and Northern Ireland tourists in Portugal to quarantine upon returning.
We'd like to hear from holidaymakers in Greece who are changing plans because of the potential move. Are you trying to come back early? Will you have to cancel your planned holiday? How are you going to manage quarantine?
