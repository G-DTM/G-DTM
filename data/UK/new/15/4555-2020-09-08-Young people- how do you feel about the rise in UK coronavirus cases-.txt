Young people: how do you feel about the rise in UK coronavirus cases?
We would like to hear what under-24s think on coronavirus case rates being higher among younger people
The deputy chief medical officer in England has said people have "relaxed too much" leading to the second biggest rise in confirmed coronavirus cases since May.
Health secretary Matt Hancock said younger people should be reminded to stick to physical distancing rules: "It's actually among more affluent younger people where we have seen the rise."
Nicola Sturgeon has said a majority of the big spike of cases in Scotland were amongst people aged 18 to 39 who were enjoying the relaxation of lockdown and physical distancing regulations by going to pubs and parties.
How do you feel about the coverage on the rise in UK coronavirus cases? Do you feel it is fair? Do you think you've been following the rules? What have you been up to since lockdown restrictions lifted? We are particularly interested in hearing from those between the ages of 17 and 24.
