England Covid restrictions: will you be attending an event this weekend?
We would like to hear from people in England who are planning on attending events this weekend before the new rules on gatherings come into force
From Monday nearly all gatherings of more than six people, whether indoors or outdoors, will be banned in England. The change in the law is to help reduce the spread of coronavirus after daily cases in the UK rose to nearly 3,000 for Sunday and Monday, as well as help police break up gatherings.
Weddings, funerals and other events such as organised Covid-secure team sports remain unchanged.
Are you attending an event this weekend before the new rules come into force? Or do you feel that you should cancel? Have you decided against attending an event?
We'd also like to hear from people who have an event or gathering planned that has been affected by the new restrictions, over the next few weeks.
What changes have you made? Will you be rearranging or cancelling your plans? How do you feel about the new law?
