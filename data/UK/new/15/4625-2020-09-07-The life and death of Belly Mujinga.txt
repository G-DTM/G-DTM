The life and death of Belly Mujinga
Guardian writer Sirin Kale spoke to friends and family of Belly Mujinga about her life and death. Belly, a transport worker and mother to an 11-year-old girl, developed Covid-19 after being allegedly spat on during her shift at London's Victoria station. Her death made headlines and raised pressing questions about racial injustice
Belly Mujinga, 47, was working on the concourse of Victoria station in central London on the morning of 22 March when an alleged incident took place that she said involved a man claiming he had Covid 19 and spitting at her. Belly later developed the virus and died on 5 April. Her death went on to make headlines and an investigation was launched. British Transport Police concluded their investigation, saying the 57-year-old man they identified from CCTV had produced a negative antibody test, showing he did not have the virus, and that there was not enough evidence to prove he had deliberately spat or coughed at Belly.
Guardian writer Sirin Kale tells Anushka Asthana about investigating the life and death of Belly Mujinga. She describes meeting Lusamba Gode Katalay, Belly's husband, and Agnes Ntumba, her cousin, who both described Belly as a loving wife, devoted mother, and kind and compassionate colleague. Sirin looks at how the story – of a frontline worker assaulted while doing her job, a black woman whose death went uninvestigated until a global anti-racism campaign forced the British authorities to take note – made Belly a symbol of racial injustice.
