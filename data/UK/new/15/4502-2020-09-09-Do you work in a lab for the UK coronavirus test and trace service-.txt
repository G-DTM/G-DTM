Do you work in a lab for the UK coronavirus test and trace service?
We would like to hear from contact tracers and people working in coronavirus testing labs. Share your experiences
NHS leaders have expressed concerns about problems in the Test and Trace service after the lack of capacity in laboratories prevented people from getting a test. Labour leader Keir Starmer has also warned that it is "on the verge of collapse".
We want to hear from those who are working as contact tracers, along with people in laboratories. We are also interested in hearing from people who have been recommended to get a test. You can get in touch here.
