Have you accessed universal credit for the first time during the coronavirus pandemic?
We would like to hear from people who have never claimed universal credit before or have not used the benefit system for some time
With the UK economy plunging into the deepest recession since records began, many people have found themselves without jobs or requiring social security support they didn't previously need due to coronavirus.
In the last few months, universal credit has become a new experience for many. We want to hear from people who have accessed it for the first time during the pandemic, or who have not used the benefit system for some time.
What has been your experience of applying online and navigating the universal credit system? Were you refused universal credit? If so why? Has it been helpful in helping you find work (or more hours) in your chosen profession/occupation?
We are particularly interested in hearing from you if you were turned down for universal credit because your savings levels exceed the Â£16k capital limit on eligibility. Or if you were previously in receipt of working tax credits but were wrongly advised to claim universal credit instead (and lost your original tax credits claim).
