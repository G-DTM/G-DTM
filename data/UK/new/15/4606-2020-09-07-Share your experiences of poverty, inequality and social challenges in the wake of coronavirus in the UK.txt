Share your experiences of poverty, inequality and social challenges in the wake of coronavirus in the UK
We would like to hear from people and organisations who have lived experience of these issues as part of a video project
The Guardian is doing an experimental and collaborative video journalism project, reporting on poverty, inequality and the social challenges we are facing in the wake of coronavirus.
We want to hear from people and organisations who have lived experience of these issues, with whom we will collaborate to make short films for the Guardian over the next few months.
If you are an organisation using video to work with communities, or you work with people with lived experience to tackle social issues, please tell us about yourself and the work you do.
The project is supported by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation.
You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish. Your responses are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions.
One of our journalists will be in touch to discuss the project, so please do leave contact details.
