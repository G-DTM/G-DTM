UK commuters: share your experiences of travelling to work
We would like to know what commuting is like during the coronavirus pandemic
About 90% of train services were restored on Monday as the government tries to encourage office workers in the UK to return to their desks.
We would like to hear from people around Britain about their commute and what has changed due to the pandemic.
Where are you commuting to and from? Have you changed the way you travel? We would also like to hear from those who are no longer commuting.
