How have you been affected by the cancellation of the Edinburgh festivals?
If you were planning on performing or attending the festivals, we'd like to hear from you
The cancellation of this year's Edinburgh festivals, including the world-famous fringe, will be felt far and wide. This year, the August festivals were due to welcome 25,000 artists from around the world, along with audiences of more than 4 million.
We want to hear how the cancellation will affect you, whether you are a performer who was planning to take a show to a festival, an arts worker, an Edinburgh resident or a fringe lover.
How have you been affected? What are your plans now for the future?
