NHS nurse dies of coronavirus at hospital where she worked
Family and friends pay tribute to Areema Nasreen, 36, who died in Walsall, West Midlands
A 36-year-old NHS nurse, who was believed to have had no underlying health issues, has died after contracting coronavirus.
Areema Nasreen died shortly after midnight on Friday in intensive care at Walsall Manor hospital in the West Midlands, where she had worked for 16 years.
Nasreen, who has three children, and was from Walsall, developed symptoms of coronavirus on 13 March, including aches, a high temperature and then a cough. She tested positive for the virus last Friday.
In a tribute posted on Facebook, her friend Rubi Aktar said: "She was the most loveliest, genuine person you could ever meet, she went above and beyond for everyone she met.
"I'm so grateful that I had the honour to call her my best friend, she saw me at my best and my worst and accepted my every flaw. I am so broken that words can't explain."
A relative told Birmingham Live: "The immediate family are devastated. Everyone is in shock this morning. She was always so full of life. She was devoted to her job as a nurse, she absolutely loved it.
"She passed away doing what she loved. I'm really sad for the rest of the family, she was a fantastic person."
The mother of three qualified as a staff nurse in January last year and worked at the hospital's acute medical unit.
She worked at Walsall Manor hospital from 2003, in housekeeping and as a healthcare assistant before studying to become a nurse.
