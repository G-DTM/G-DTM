After ministers had rejected the idea, the government announced on Monday that everyone in England would have to wear a face covering when in shops and supermarkets from 24 July. Heather and Polly look at how the public is supposed to have confidence in what the government asks of us, when even ministers struggle to stay on message.
And, on Tuesday, the government announced that the UK would phase out Huawei from any role it had in the country's 5G and broadband networks by 2027. Dan Sabbagh looks at why the decision uncovers a large faultline between this Tory government and its own MPs.
Plus, on a day in which the Welsh parliament debates the need for an independence referendum, Rajeev Syal speaks with the Welsh minister for health and social services, Vaughan Gething.
