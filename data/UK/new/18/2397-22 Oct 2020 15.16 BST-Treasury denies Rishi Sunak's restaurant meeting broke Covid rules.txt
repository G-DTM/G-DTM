Treasury denies Rishi Sunak's restaurant meeting broke Covid rules
From 2 December, England will be divided into three different tiers of restrictions. They are slightly amended from the previous system.
Across all tiers, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector are set to reopen. Collective worship and weddings – with a maximum of 15 in attendance – can also resume.
Tier one
Under the new system hospitality businesses in England can stay open until 11pm with table service only but last orders must be made by 10pm, in an effort to stagger departures. The"rule of six"will also remain in place indoors, meaning social household mixing is still allowed.
Spectator sport is set to resume, albeit with limits on numbers and abiding by social distancing. In tier 1, there will be a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of occupancy of the stadium or 4,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
In tier 1, people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. Support bubbles – which allowed a single household to join with another household – are also being broadened across all tiers. Parents with a child under one will be able to form a support bubble, as well as those with a child under five who needs continuous care, such as a child with a disability. Also, in cases where there is a single adult carer, for a partner with dementia for example, they would also be able to form a support bubble.

Tier two
Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.
As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.
Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close.

Tier three
Hospitality venues will have to close, except for delivery and takeaway service. In tier 3, hotels and other accommodation providers must also close, except for specific work purposes where people cannot return home. Outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, will be allowed to continue in all tiers, as will amateur team sports such as football. Unlike the first two tiers, spectators will not be allowed to watch sport in tier 3.

Chancellor met hospitality industry representatives at London branch of pizza chain
Rishi Sunak did not flout lockdown rules by holding a meeting in a branch of a pizza chain in Waterloo to discuss his latest business support package, because it was "not a functioning restaurant at the time", the Treasury has said.
The Treasury issued a press release featuring 12 photos of the chancellor and the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, sitting around a table at a branch of Franco Manca in south London with representatives of hospitality businesses.
The mixing of members of different households in indoor hospitality settings is currently prohibited in the capital, and office staff are urged to work from home where possible.

Boris Johnson's official spokesman was asked on Thursday about whether business meetings could be held in restaurants or cafes in areas under tier 2 restrictions.
He said: "There is an exemption for work meetings to take place in hospitality settings. Our intention when providing that exemption had been to provide the opportunity for freelancers or for the self-employed who didn't have an office space to work in, to use hospitality if necessary."
He added: "What we would ask people to do wherever possible is to hold meetings remotely, via phone or via video conference or whatever it might be."
Challenged about whether Sunak had broken the rules, a Treasury spokesperson said: "The restaurant was not a functioning restaurant at the time. There were no customers in the restaurant at the time and it was all Covid-secure including face masks worn and social distanced."
Attendees were pictured seated apart from one another around long tables, with pastries and water.
Aides said Sunak believed it was important to show his support and solidarity with the hard-hit hospitality sector, which has been pressing for more financial backing for months.
Sunak had previously been criticised for launching his "eat out to help out" scheme in the summer by serving food at a branch of the noodle chain Wagamama without wearing a face mask – though they were not mandatory for hospitality staff until September.
Treasury announcements are meticulously branded and often feature Sunak's signature prominently, sometimes to the irritation of Tory colleagues. Adviser Cass Horowitz is often credited with burnishing his personal brand.
