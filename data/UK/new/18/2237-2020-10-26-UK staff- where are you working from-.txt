UK staff: where are you working from?
We would like to hear from those who are working in places other than the office or their homes
Some people who are working from home have been looking for alternative workplaces, such as fitness clubs and cocktail bars, to break the monotony of working at the kitchen table.
Guardian business reporter Joanna Partridge said: "Businesses are hoping that the offer of a desk, reliable wifi and refreshments will attract workers weary of half a year of working from home, while boosting their income in challenging times."
We want to hear about the different places people in the UK are working from when they are not at home.
Why is it important for you not to be working at home? How do you feel being able to work from a different location?
