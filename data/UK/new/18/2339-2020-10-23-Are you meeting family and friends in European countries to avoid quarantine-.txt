Are you meeting family and friends in European countries to avoid quarantine?
We would like to hear from those who are meeting others in countries that are listed as safe to travel to without quarantine
Friends, families and couples who have been separated by coronavirus restrictions and want to avoid quarantine are able to meet in some European countries that are listed as safe to travel to. For example, those living in the UK and in Germany can meet each other in the Canary Islands without having to quarantine on arrival or when returning to their own country.
We want to hear from those who are travelling to other countries to meet loved ones they haven't seen since the start of the pandemic.
Who are you meeting and in which country? What was your experience like travelling there and back?
