'Sex ban': England's Covid tiers throw new obstacles in way of romance
From 2 December, England will be divided into three different tiers of restrictions. They are slightly amended from the previous system.
Across all tiers, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector are set to reopen. Collective worship and weddings – with a maximum of 15 in attendance – can also resume.
Tier one
Under the new system hospitality businesses in England can stay open until 11pm with table service only but last orders must be made by 10pm, in an effort to stagger departures. The"rule of six"will also remain in place indoors, meaning social household mixing is still allowed.
Spectator sport is set to resume, albeit with limits on numbers and abiding by social distancing. In tier 1, there will be a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of occupancy of the stadium or 4,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
In tier 1, people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. Support bubbles – which allowed a single household to join with another household – are also being broadened across all tiers. Parents with a child under one will be able to form a support bubble, as well as those with a child under five who needs continuous care, such as a child with a disability. Also, in cases where there is a single adult carer, for a partner with dementia for example, they would also be able to form a support bubble.

Tier two
Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.
As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.
Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close.

Tier three
Hospitality venues will have to close, except for delivery and takeaway service. In tier 3, hotels and other accommodation providers must also close, except for specific work purposes where people cannot return home. Outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, will be allowed to continue in all tiers, as will amateur team sports such as football. Unlike the first two tiers, spectators will not be allowed to watch sport in tier 3.

Some couples living apart and not in each other's support bubble not allowed to meet indoors
It has hardly been the easiest time for single people to find love, with an ever-changing profusion of rules throughout the pandemic blocking their path to meeting that special someone.
But now those waiting for Cupid's arrow to strike have been dealt a fresh blow – as Downing Street has confirmed that couples living apart in areas under tougher restrictions can only meet outdoors, unless they are in support bubbles.
And, if the prospect of outdoor-only encounters during the bitter winter months was not grim enough, Boris Johnson's official spokesman clarified that they are not even meant to touch each other under social distancing rules.
With more than half of England's population set to be living in areas classed as "high " or "very high" alert – the top two tiers of Covid restrictions – by midnight on Friday, the rules, described by some as a "sex ban", could break the hearts of many.
Asked if couples living apart in tier 2 areas can see each other indoors, the prime minister's official spokesman said on Friday: "The rules on household mixing in tier 2, I think, set out that you should mix with your own household only unless you've formed a support bubble, and that obviously does apply to some couples."
The prime minister's spokesman clarified that the restrictions were set out in law. According to the government, a support bubble is where "a household with one adult joins with another household. Households in that support bubble can still visit each other, stay overnight, and visit public places together." However, if neither person in a couple lived alone, they would not be able to form a support bubble – meaning they could only meet outdoors with each other in tier 2 areas.

Asked why an exemption for "established relationships" was not written into the law for those in tiers 2 and 3, Johnson's spokesman added: "Because the purpose of the measures we've put in place is to break the chain of transmission between households, and the scientific advice is that there is greatest transmission of the virus indoors."
Pressed on whether the government expects couples in established relationships meeting outdoors to socially distance, the spokesman said that the rules set out that people should "follow social distancing and the hand, face, space rules".
