Covid: Dominic Raab refuses to deny possibility of tier 4 restrictions
From 2 December, England will be divided into three different tiers of restrictions. They are slightly amended from the previous system.
Across all tiers, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector are set to reopen. Collective worship and weddings – with a maximum of 15 in attendance – can also resume.
Tier one
Under the new system hospitality businesses in England can stay open until 11pm with table service only but last orders must be made by 10pm, in an effort to stagger departures. The"rule of six"will also remain in place indoors, meaning social household mixing is still allowed.
Spectator sport is set to resume, albeit with limits on numbers and abiding by social distancing. In tier 1, there will be a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of occupancy of the stadium or 4,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
In tier 1, people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. Support bubbles – which allowed a single household to join with another household – are also being broadened across all tiers. Parents with a child under one will be able to form a support bubble, as well as those with a child under five who needs continuous care, such as a child with a disability. Also, in cases where there is a single adult carer, for a partner with dementia for example, they would also be able to form a support bubble.

Tier two
Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.
As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.
Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close.

Tier three
Hospitality venues will have to close, except for delivery and takeaway service. In tier 3, hotels and other accommodation providers must also close, except for specific work purposes where people cannot return home. Outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, will be allowed to continue in all tiers, as will amateur team sports such as football. Unlike the first two tiers, spectators will not be allowed to watch sport in tier 3.

Foreign secretary says UK government is prepared to take further measures if necessary
The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has refused to deny that ministers are considering introducing a higher tier 4 level of coronavirus restrictions, less than three weeks after the launch of the three-tier lockdown model.
Officials are reportedly drawing up plans for an extra layer of measures forcing restaurants and non-essential shops to close in parts of England with the highest infection rates.
Asked whether a new tier 4 was being considered, Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday: "We're always ready for further measures that we can take. But I think the most important thing about further measures is that we continue on the track we're on of targeting the virus."

Ministers are under increasing pressure to announce a nationwide circuit breaker as hospital admissions in badly hit parts of the country exceed the height of the first wave.
Raab, who in effect is Boris Johnson's number two, insisted the "overwhelming scientific advice" to the government was that local lockdowns were "the right way to go".
He said the government was "striving to avoid" a second national lockdown despite France, Germany and Wales announcing similar countrywide measures in recent days.
He told Sky News that the idea of "a short, sharp circuit breaker is frankly something of an enigma" and that those calling for one had not set out the exit route from a national intervention.
The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) advised five weeks ago that the government should urgently consider a nationwide two-week circuit breaker lockdown – similar to that in spring while keeping most schools open – but this was ignored at the time.
Raab said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that "the overwhelming scientific advice to us is targeted measures are the right way to go if you take them and you're committed to them".
He added: "The arbitrariness of a blanket approach would be far worse than the effects of trying to be as targeted as possible" and that a localised approach was "fair" and "fits the natural justice that we're focusing on the areas where the uptick is the greatest".
