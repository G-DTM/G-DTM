UK furloughed workers: tell us about your experiences
We want to hear how you are finding it and whether you are at risk of being made redundant
On 1 November, the job support scheme will replace furlough with a funding package which will mean an employee will only need to work 20% of their usual hours to benefit.
The government has also cut the level of employer contribution from 33% â€“ to just 5%, meaning the government will pay 62% of a worker's wages for the time they are away from their job.
We want to hear about your experiences.
