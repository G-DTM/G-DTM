Liverpool mayor urges people to follow Covid-19 rules as brother in ICU
City region was first area to face tier 3 local lockdown restrictions in England
The mayor of Liverpool has revealed his brother is in intensive care with Covid-19 and urged people to follow the rules to prevent the spread of the virus.
Joe Anderson said on Twitter that his eldest brother was in a "very serious condition" in hospital. He tweeted on Friday: "10 mins ago my sister-in-law a Nursing Sister has told me my eldest brother her husband has got Covid-19."
His tweet also highlighted a video shared by the Liverpool city council Twitter account that featured Dr Richard Wenstone making a plea for people to follow coronavirus rules to ease pressure on the NHS.
Anderson added: "Please watch the video, follow the rules &amp; understand why we all need to fight the enemy #Covid."
Earlier on Friday, he joined Liverpool city region leaders in branding the tier system of coronavirus regulations a "shambles", following the announcement that gyms in Lancashire can stay open under the strictest measures.
Gyms and leisure centres in Liverpool, Wirral, St Helens, Sefton, Knowsley and Halton were ordered to close from Wednesday as the area was placed in tier 3. However, tier 3 measures for Lancashire announced on Friday did not include the closure of gyms.
Gym owner Nicholas Whitcombe was fined Â£1,000 when he refused to close Body Tech Fitness in Moreton, Wirral, on Wednesday.
Liverpool city region leaders said they were given no choice on the package of measures but a government spokesman said the interventions were a result of consultation with local authorities.
Anderson tweeted earlier: "Liverpool city region has demanded immediate clarification on why Lancashire gyms are allowed to stay open and Liverpool's close.
"Inconsistent mess, we now have tier 3 A and tier 3 B." He ended his tweet with "#shambles".
