Coronavirus: Oxford, Luton and parts of Yorkshire move to tier 2
Health secretary announces agreement to move areas to high local Covid alert
A number of areas in England will move to tier 2 from tier 1 coronavirus restrictions from midnight on Friday, the Department of Health has said.
They are the East Riding of Yorkshire, Kingston-upon-Hull, North East Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire, Dudley, Staffordshire, Telford and the Wrekin; Amber Valley, Bolsover, Derbyshire Dales, Derby City, South Derbyshire, the whole of High Peak; Charnwood Luton and Oxford.
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: "We continue to see a worrying rise in cases right across the country, and it is clear decisive action is needed.
"We have agreed with local leaders to move more areas into the high local Covid alert level this week. These restrictions are challenging for us all, but it is only by working together and following the rules that we will bring down the rates of infection.
"A failure to act now will only lead to longer disruption and greater economic damage.
"I want to thank everyone who is playing their part to break the chains of transmission across the country. We will beat this virus, but we must stick together as we enter the winter months."
