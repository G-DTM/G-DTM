BBC's Martin Bashir 'seriously unwell' with Covid-related complications
Veteran journalist, 57, best known for his 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales
The veteran journalist Martin Bashir is "seriously unwell" with coronavirus-related complications, the BBC has said. The 57-year-old, best known for his 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, currently works as the BBC News religion editor.
A spokeswoman for the BBC said: "We are sorry to say that Martin is seriously unwell with Covid-19-related complications. Everyone at the BBC is wishing him a full recovery. We'd ask that his privacy, and that of his family, is respected at this time."
Bashir began working as a journalist in 1986 but made headlines around the world in 1995 for his BBC interview with Diana for Panorama. That interview has seen renewed interest in the lead up to a new Channel 4 film, which examines the circumstances behind their meeting, airing on Wednesday night.
Bashir's other high-profile interviews have included the suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder case, entertainer Michael Barrymore, Jeffrey Archer and Major Charles Ingram, dubbed "the coughing major". In 2003, he conducted a series of interviews for the controversial ITV documentary Living With Michael Jackson.
He later moved to the US where he co-anchored the current affairs show Nightline on ABC before moving to MSNBC, where he served as a political commentator until 2013. He subsequently returned to the BBC as the broadcaster's religion editor.
In October 2019 he competed in the celebrity spin-off of X Factor.
