Gyms allowed to reopen in Merseyside after tier 3 Covid row
From 2 December, England will be divided into three different tiers of restrictions. They are slightly amended from the previous system.
Across all tiers, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector are set to reopen. Collective worship and weddings – with a maximum of 15 in attendance – can also resume.
Tier one
Under the new system hospitality businesses in England can stay open until 11pm with table service only but last orders must be made by 10pm, in an effort to stagger departures. The"rule of six"will also remain in place indoors, meaning social household mixing is still allowed.
Spectator sport is set to resume, albeit with limits on numbers and abiding by social distancing. In tier 1, there will be a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of occupancy of the stadium or 4,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
In tier 1, people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. Support bubbles – which allowed a single household to join with another household – are also being broadened across all tiers. Parents with a child under one will be able to form a support bubble, as well as those with a child under five who needs continuous care, such as a child with a disability. Also, in cases where there is a single adult carer, for a partner with dementia for example, they would also be able to form a support bubble.

Tier two
Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.
As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.
Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.
Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close.
The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be foundhere.
Tier three
Hospitality venues will have to close, except for delivery and takeaway service. In tier 3, hotels and other accommodation providers must also close, except for specific work purposes where people cannot return home. Outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, will be allowed to continue in all tiers, as will amateur team sports such as football. Unlike the first two tiers, spectators will not be allowed to watch sport in tier 3.

Ministers had faced criticism for ordering closures while letting them stay open in other tier 3 areas
Gyms will be allowed to reopen in Merseyside after the UK government failed to provide evidence that they should close under the top-tier strict coronavirus restrictions imposed only a week ago.
Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, has strongly criticised ministers for ordering the closure of gyms and leisure centres in Merseyside while allowing them to remain open in the other tier 3 areas Lancashire and Greater Manchester.
Rotheram announced on Wednesday morning that gyms would be allowed to reopen in the region.
He said the government agreed on Tuesday night that it would rescind its original decision. He told BBC Radio Merseyside: "It's a very, very difficult period for us all. We've been trying to work with the government to understand why this particular suite of restrictions would be the right ones for us and also to get the support package."
The move represents a humiliating climbdown from Boris Johnson's government only seven days after the Liverpool city region became the first place in England to enter tier 3 restrictions.

The three-tier lockdown system was designed to simplify the imposition of Covid restrictions across the country but within days it had been beset with difficulties, including a damaging public row with Greater Manchester leaders.
Earlier this week, Rotheram and the region's six council leaders demanded an urgent review of the closure of gyms after they were allowed to stay open in Lancashire, which struck a tier 3 deal on Friday.
Rotheram said he had been in discussions with Downing Street "late into the night" and that officials agreed that gyms could reopen safely in Merseyside.
He said: "The government have agreed with the case that I put forward on behalf of the city region leaders and that they would now bring us in line with other tier 3 areas, similar to Lancashire and Greater Manchester when they have their orders placed. This would mean that soft play areas will be closed but gyms could reopen.
"I think that will provide consistency of approach, which is what we asked for, and take away the confusion of people in our area that things were being imposed here but not elsewhere."
