London restaurant famed as 80s celebrity haunt has been battered by Covid pandemic
Langan's Brasserie, the London restaurant once co-owned by the actor Michael Caine and famous as a 1980s celebrity haunt frequented by diners as diverse as Princess Margaret, Muhammad Ali and Mick Jagger, is teetering on the brink of administration.
Up to 100 jobs are at risk at the brasserie, which was opened in 1976 by Caine and the restaurateur Peter Langan.
The eatery was a favourite destination for the rich and famous, and known for the antics of Langan, who would climb on tables and crawl beneath them to nibble his customers' ankles. He once put out a fire in the kitchen with vintage champagne.
The restaurant, in Stratton Street, Mayfair, central London, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal measure that provides 10 working days of protection from creditors as advisers examine options for the business.
The brasserie has been battered by Covid-19 restrictions and a lack of tourists in the capital; it also faces the end of the UK government's furlough scheme, due to end on 31 October.
The financial advisory firm Begbies Traynor has been lined up as potential administrator and is understood to be in talks with a number of possible rescuers, thought to include Richard Caring, owner of The Ivy restaurant and a string of other upscale London diners including Scott's.

Langan lined the walls of the restaurant with work by artists including David Hockney, a regular at the restaurant, who helped design the menus turning them into collectors' pieces, and Patrick Caulfield.
The Irish restaurateur had a reputation for throwing out customers, but the restaurant, which had no dress code, pulled in stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando and Mick Jagger in 1970s and 1980s to dine on its signature dish of spinach soufflé with anchovy sauce.
Caine reportedly said of Langan: "Peter stumbles around in a cloud of his own vomit and is a complete social embarrassment. You would have a more interesting conversation with a cabbage." Langan died in 1988 aged 47.
The chef Richard Shepherd, who joined Langan's in 1977 and was instrumental in its survival for more than 40 years, retains an interest in the business, although it is controlled by the entrepreneur Vijay Malde and former Bolton Wanderers chairman Ken Anderson.
Langan's closed temporarily in March just ahead of high-street lockdowns. It has not reopened. Staff were retained under the furlough job protection scheme but have been told their jobs are at risk now.
Restaurateurs said London's dining establishments were under serious strain from the loss of tourists and high-spending shoppers during the pandemic. New coronavirus restrictions on meeting other households indoors and the advice to avoid public transport were also taking a toll.
One rival restaurant group said it had thousands of cancellations last weekend as "tier 2" restrictions were imposed; another said that many restaurants in London were experiencing a 75% slump in takings.
One said Langan's might struggle to find a buyer. "All restaurants have been struggling since March. After lockdown we were starting to see a recovery when more restrictions came in and knocked it for six.
"Restaurants like Langan's? How can they survive without regular visitors from out of town who want a relaxing long lunch or dinne? Those people are not around any more. London has been crippled and on the course we are on it could take a decade or more for it to recover."
Other London landmarks including Simpsons on the Strand, several Brasserie Blancs, and Le Caprice restaurant have also kept their doors closed since the lockdown in England ended. The Soho restaurant Polpo went into administration as did the dining chains Carluccio's and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.
