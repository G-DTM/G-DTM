Have you been asked to provide proof of identity when socialising in UK pubs?
We'd like to hear from people who've been asked whether they have been asked to share proof of where they live when socialising in UK pubs
The hospitality industry has been working out how to deal with the various lockdown instructions coming from the government.
With many people now prevented from meeting in pubs, restaurants and other businesses with anyone from outside their households, we would like to hear from anyone who has been told they must provide proof where they live with the people they are socialising with.
