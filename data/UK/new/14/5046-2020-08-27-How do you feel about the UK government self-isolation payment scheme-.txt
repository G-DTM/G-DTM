How do you feel about the UK government self-isolation payment scheme?
We'd like to hear from people impacted by the new scheme which enables people on low incomes to claim payments of up to £182
People on low incomes in areas with high coronavirus infection rates will be eligible for a payment of up to £182 if they are forced to self-isolate, the government has announced.
The scheme, which will be trialled from Tuesday in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle, follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who warned that millions of people could not afford to isolate without pay for 14 days.
We'd like to hear from people on low incomes on their thoughts on the new scheme. We're particularly interested in hearing from people in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle.
How do you feel about the scheme? Do you feel the payments are enough to encourage people to self-isolate?
