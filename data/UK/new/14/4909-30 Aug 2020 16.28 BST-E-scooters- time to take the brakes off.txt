E-scooters: time to take the brakes off
The government must stop dragging its feet when it comes to encouraging the use of e-scooters, argues Hilary Saunders
Your article about e-scooters (UK rides the wave of micromobility by embracing e-scooters, 25 August) failed to raise some vital questions.
As electric scooters can cost as little as Â£120, they could provide the ideal transport for low-income commuters, while helping to reduce carbon emissions, especially in cities. It would not cost much to mark out a lane on arterial roads for the use of bicycles and e-scooters.
Why is the government not investing in the production of e-scooters; requiring supermarkets and workplaces to provide secure lockers for them, and encouraging employers to offer loans to enable employees to purchase e-scooters?
Why is it only legal in Britain to use a rented e-scooter in designated local trials, especially when sharing them carries a risk of contracting Covid-19?
And why is the government allowing Lime, a Silicon Valley startup, to dominate the new e-scooter rental market?
