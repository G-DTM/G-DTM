How did Britain get so overweight?
As the government launches a newly interventionist strategy to tackle obesity, the Guardian's Felicity Lawrence looks at whether it goes far enough to take on the might of the food industry
Boris Johnson once scoffed at what he saw as the "nanny state" instincts of politicians who sought to tackle the growing waistlines of the British public. He ridiculed veganism as a crime against cheese-lovers and promised that Brexit would not interrupt supply lines of Mars bars and crisps. But after his bout of Covid-19 and brush with death, he has had an epiphany. This week the government announced it would ban junk food ads before 9pm and put an end to buy-one-get-one-free deals in supermarkets as part of its new obesity strategy.
The Guardian's Felicity Lawrence has been investigating the powerful food industry for more than 20 years and is the author of several books on the subject. She tells Anushka Asthana that any route out of the obesity crisis needs to take seriously the complex issues of education and economic inequality as well as the prevalence and attractiveness of junk food.
