Tell us: will you be returning to indoor gyms, pools and sports halls in England?
Following more than four months of closure, indoor sports facilities in England can reopen this Saturday. Share your thoughts
Indoor gyms, swimming pools and sports facilities in England are allowed to reopen from 25 July following more than four months of closure due to the coronavirus lockdown.
We'd like to hear from people who work in these places about how they feel about returning. Had you been furloughed, or did you find other means of employment work during the lockdown? We would also like to hear to people who use gyms, pools and sports halls to work out â€“ how do you feel about returning, and how have you been exercising while facilities were closed?
