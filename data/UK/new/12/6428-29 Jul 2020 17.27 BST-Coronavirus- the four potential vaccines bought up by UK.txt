Coronavirus: the four potential vaccines bought up by UK
Britain takes its stockpile to 250m doses after most recent agreement
Four potential Covid-19 vaccines have been secured so far by the UK, which aims to buy up to 12 to ensure that the country has one or more that work as soon as possible. They are:
The government has a deal for 100m doses of the adenovector potential vaccine, which uses an adenovirus responsible for an infection in chimps, similar to the common cold, to get into cells and deliver immunity.
Britain has bought 30m doses of the vaccine, which has done well in early trials and is designed along similar lines to that being developed by Imperial College London, which has research funding from the government. These vaccines use genetic code rather than killed or attenuated parts of the virus itself. No vaccine developed on this model has yet been licensed.
The deal in principle is for 60m doses, with funding to support the French company's research. It has a factory in Scotland, where it is developing a vaccine based on the killed, whole virus, which is a traditional approach. There is a possibility to extend the deal to 100m doses if the vaccine is successful.
The UK government will buy 60m doses if the vaccine is effective in clinical trials, which are scheduled to start in September. The vaccine is based on another traditional approach, using an adjuvant that boosts the immune system to help it fight off the virus. This method holds particular promise for vaccinating older people, because the immune system weakens as years go by.
