Getting hold of the Guardian | Cheese options | Student antics | Travel quarantine | Head of mortality | Michael Portillo
Getting hold of garlic or cheese is one thing (Letters, 30 July). In the 1970s we moved to an estate in the suburbs of Hull. When I asked for the Guardian in the paper shop, I was told: "Thursday". Seeing my bafflement, they said: "Beverley Guardian comes out on a Thursday."Rosemary WaughYork

It wasn't graffiti (Letters, 29 July) but I recall a group of students who would relieve themselves against the high iron gates to Trinity College gardens after closing time at the King's Arms in Oxford. They called themselves the National Rust.Richard HarleyAlresford, Hampshire

What happens to Michael Portillo's extensive wardrobe after filming (Report, 29 July; Letters, 30 July)? Do the clothes go to a charity auction? If so, what's his jacket size?Peter BarnesMilton Keynes
