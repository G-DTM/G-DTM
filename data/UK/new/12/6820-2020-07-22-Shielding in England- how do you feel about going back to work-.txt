Shielding in England: how do you feel about going back to work?
We'd like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to work
From 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.
They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is 'Covid-secure'.
If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we'd like to hear from you.
How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months? Has your employer been supportive? Do you have any concerns? Or have you decided to continue working from home?
