"Who that benefits is of no interest to me" (Robert Jenrick says he regrets dining with donor before planning decision, 22 July). It is deeply depressing, though not in the least surprising, that a Conservative housing minister would see a decision whether money should go to a millionaire developer and Tory donor, or to one of the most deprived communities in the country as morally neutral. It speaks volumes of the ethos of the modern Conservative party and why they are unfit to govern.Jeremy CushingExeter
Has Boris Johnson no one to warn him off using grandiose phrases such as "sheer might", as in his oration to the Scots on Thursday? Dr Spooner springs to mind.Michael McGeeverMenai Bridge, Anglesey
The government's proscription of amateur music-making (Sing into the funnel please: inside the Covid-19 lab hoping to declare singing safe, 22 July) has led to a huge increase in criminality. All over the country small groups are meeting in gardens and garages to play in illicit saxophone quartets and small brass ensembles. After 77 years of the greatest probity, I never thought playing the saxophone would lead me into delinquency.Owen WellsIlkley, West Yorkshire
Bach? Clapton? Green? Given the state of the world, I think Nietzsche probably got it right when he wrote in 1882 that God is dead – and we killed him (Letters, 23 July).Paul TattamChinley, Derbyshire
I didn't realise that being "plebeian" – a member of the common people – was synonymous with being "vulgar" (Quick crossword, 13 down, 23 July). I hope none of them are regular Guardian readers.Declan O'NeillOldham, Greater Manchester
