Covid winter: share your stories of embracing outdoor life
Our video team wants to hear how European communities have embraced socialising outside – way before Covid restrictions came into place
For many, physical distancing while socialising has been easier in the summer. But as winter approaches in western Europe and coronavirus restrictions get tighter in some countries, many people are trying to work out how to continue seeing friends and family from a distance.
It could be looking to the Norwegian concept of friluftsliv for inspiration – meaning to embrace the outdoors. Or stocking up on outdoor heaters and fire pits as people have done in the UK.
The Guardian video team is looking for communities across the continent who are already adept at spending a lot of their social time outside and who would be willing to offer us a window in to their world.
