Shielding in the UK: how are you feeling about the winter months?
We would like to hear from those who are high risk on their thoughts on the coronavirus pandemic and the next few months
With cases of coronavirus cases rising across the UK, many people who are at high risk are trying to decide what to do in the next few months. As more of the population start presenting with cold and flu-like symptoms as the weather gets colder, Guardian columnist Frances Ryan said: "If the challenge for society in the coming months is to figure out how best to live with coronavirus, this is all the greater for people with underlying health conditions."
We want to hear from those who are most at risk from coronavirus on how they feel about the coming winter months.
If you are working, do you feel safe? Are you still shielding or will you start shielding again? Do you agree with the government? Do you have any concerns?
