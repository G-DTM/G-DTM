Do you have concerns about neighbours' behaviour as UK coronavirus cases rise?
We'd like to hear from people about their thoughts on neighbour's behaviour as the number of UK coronavirus cases increases. Share your experiences
As the number of UK coronavirus cases rises again, there have been reports of growing tensions in communities between people with different interpretations of the rules.
With the government suggesting that people with concerns over their neighbours' behaviour should consider reporting them to the police, we want to hear from you about the effect of the crisis on your community.
Do you feel confident that your neighbours have been careful about the 'rule of six' and other guidelines? Have you ever been concerned about your health or that of others in your area as a result? Have you talked to them about those concerns, or even reported them? Or have you seen examples of constructive criticism leading to better outcomes for the community?
