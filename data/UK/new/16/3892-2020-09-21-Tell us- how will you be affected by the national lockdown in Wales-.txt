Tell us: how will you be affected by the national lockdown in Wales?
We'd like to hear how the two-week 'firebreak' in Wales may affect you. Share your views and experiences with us
A temporary national lockdown will be imposed in Wales, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has announced.
It's hoped the two-week "firebreak" thoughout Wales which comes into force on Friday at 6pm – until Monday 9 November – will help prevent the spread of coronavirus. About 2.3 million people in Wales are already living under local lockdown rules, in 15 of Wales's 22 counties plus Bangor and Llanelli.
We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences. We're interested in hearing from those who are working directly with the pandemic, whether it's with the NHS or as a frontline worker in another capacity.
How will you be affected by the local lockdown? Do you have any concerns? How do you feel about measures being reintroduced?
