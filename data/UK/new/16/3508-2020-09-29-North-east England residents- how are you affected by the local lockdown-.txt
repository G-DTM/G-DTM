North-east England residents: how are you affected by the local lockdown?
We want to hear from people living and working in the north-east about how coronavirus restrictions will impact them
From Friday, people in Teesside will be banned by law from mixing with other households indoors in the latest extension of lockdown restrictions.
Other places already affected by restrictions in north-east England include Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland.
We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences. We're interested in hearing from those who are working directly with the pandemic, whether it's with the NHS or local test and trace.
