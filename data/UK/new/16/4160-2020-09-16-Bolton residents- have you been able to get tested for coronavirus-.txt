Bolton residents: have you been able to get tested for coronavirus?
We would like to hear from people in the northern town about their testing experiences and the issues they have encountered
People with coronavirus symptoms in Bolton – which has the highest infection rate of Covid-19 in the country – are being forced to travel hundreds of miles for tests.
Pressure has been growing on the government as people across the UK reported being unable to secure tests locally, with some forced to make round trips of more than four hours. Even in England's 10 worst-hit coronavirus hotspots, many people reported being unable to get a test.
People desperate for coronavirus tests in the northern town have also been turning up at the "very busy" Royal Bolton Hospital A&amp;E with hospital bosses issuing a plea for the public to stop attending.
The borough still has the highest infection rate of Covid-19 in the country, with 189 new positive tests registered for every 100,000 people over the last week.
Have you been able to get a coronavirus test? What has your experience been like?
