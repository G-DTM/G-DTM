Frontline workers to be recognised in Queen's birthday honours
Recipients' 'dedication and compassion' amid pandemic praised by PM
Hundreds of frontline and community heroes who played a key role in the coronavirus pandemic response will be recognised in the Queen's birthday honours next month, Boris Johnson has said.
The prime minister praised the "dedication, courage and compassion" shown by the recipients, whose contributions to national life will be honoured, alongside people recognised for a broad range of achievements, on 10 October.
The list was due to be published in June but was postponed by the prime minister to enable nominations of those who went above and beyond in the early months of the response to Covid-19. It will reward the work of hundreds of doctors, nurses, fundraisers and volunteers who stepped up amid the crisis.
Johnson said the pandemic was the greatest health challenge in our lifetime. "As we all redouble our efforts to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives this winter, I am pleased we have an opportunity to recognise those who have given so much to this country already.
"We all have to play our part, but the dedication, courage and compassion seen from these recipients, be it responding on the frontline or out in their communities providing support to the most vulnerable, is an inspiration to us all.
"We owe them a debt of gratitude and the 2020 Queen's Birthday honours will be the first of many occasions where we can thank them as a nation."
In July, centenarian Captain Sir Tom Moore received a knighthood after his sponsored walks around his garden with the aid of his walking frame raised a record-breaking Â£39m for the NHS and lifted the spirits of the nation. He was knighted by the Queen during a unique open-air ceremony at Windsor Castle.
