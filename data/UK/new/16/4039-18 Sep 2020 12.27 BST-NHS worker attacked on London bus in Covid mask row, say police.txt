NHS worker attacked on London bus in Covid mask row, say police
Police seek man who allegedly assaulted passenger who moved away from him on bus
Police are searching for a man seen stamping on the head of an NHS test and trace worker in an attack officers believe was related to face masks.
The 63-year-old victim was left hospitalised and unable to remember the incident, which took place on a bus in north London just over three weeks ago, police said.
He boarded the route 149 bus near Seven Sisters in Tottenham at 9.45pm on 23 August. The alleged attacker got on at the next stop. About five minutes later, the victim was punched repeatedly and CCTV footage shows that his head was stamped on five times after he had fallen to the floor.
"Although there is no sound on the CCTV and all the victim remembers is waking up in hospital, we believe that this was all triggered by face masks. We think that the attacker, who had his face covering beneath his chin, took offence when the victim, who was fully covered, consciously moved away from him," said PC Chris Bowman, from the roads and transport policing command.
"When the attacker then follows the victim to the back of the bus, he can be seen pointing and gesturing at the victim's face mask before he starts repeatedly punching and kicking him. This was a totally unwarranted violent assault and we urgently need to speak to this man.
"If anyone knows who he is or has any other information – or witnessed this offence – please call."
Officers described the alleged attacker as aged about 23 to 25, black and with an athletic or muscular build. He was wearing blue tracksuit bottoms, a white vest and white trainers.
