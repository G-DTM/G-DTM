Morrison government is poised to unveil an economic stimulus package worth more than $15bn as recession speculation grows
Concerns about the coronavirus and the capacity of governments, particularly the Trump administration, to deliver timely stimulus have triggered a fresh dive on the Australian stock market amid renewed speculation the economy is heading into recession.
Australia's confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 122 on Wednesday, with 10 new cases reported by state health officials across the country. With infections growing, and Australia still attempting to contain community transmissions, the Morrison government also extended the travel ban to Italy, effective from 6pm. Travel bans are already in place for travellers from China, Iran and South Korea.
Three Formula One team members in Melbourne have been put into self-isolation as they await coronavirus test results ahead of the Australian Grand Prix. They showed fever symptoms while at the track and have been placed under isolation at their hotels.
With concerns an economic downturn could see hundreds of thousands of people out of work, the government will make supporting apprentices a focus of its looming economic stimulus package. The government will fund a new subsidy for employers with the objective of keeping around 120,000 apprentices in work.
The scheme, costing $1.3bn over the next six months, will offer small businesses with fewer than 20 full-time workers up to $7,000 in wage assistance for each apprentice per quarter, and will apply for both the retention of existing apprentices and the re-employment of someone who loses their position as a result of the coronavirus downturn.
The wage subsidy will amount to 50% of the apprentice's or trainee's wage up until the end of September, and will be offered to a new employer if a small business can't afford to hold on to staff.
All businesses and group training organisations that re-engage an eligible out-of-trade apprentice or trainee previously employed by a small business will be eligible for the subsidy.
With the ASX closing down 3.6% on Wednesday, and the Morrison government poised to unveil a package of stimulatory measures worth more than $15bn on Thursday, the ratings agency S&amp;P predicted a recession was now likely by June.
Echoing Scott Morrison earlier in the week, S&amp;P predicted the coronavirus would deliver a bigger hit to the Australian economy than the global financial crisis did in 2008. "We believe Australia's economy will move into recession by June 2020, and grow just 1.2% in 2020 before rebounding," the agency said in a note to clients.
It said a recession and the government's "imminent stimulus package" would not put at risk the country's AAA credit rating, which helps keep the cost of commonwealth borrowing low.
South Australia confirmed two more cases on Wednesday afternoon and evening, Western Australia three, New South Wales three and Queensland two.
In Queensland, the health department confirmed that a 32-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man from the Gold Coast had tested positive after returning from recent travel in the US.
In South Australia, the chief public health officer, Nicola Spurrier, said the two new cases were men who had travelled to Italy and Austria, and south-east Asia respectively.
In NSW, the number of cases rose to 65. Three of the newly diagnosed people were women who returned from Italy together, and one was a man who had contact with a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge â€“ an aged facility where two people had died from the virus.

The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said community transmission in Australia at this point was "small and controlled". With medical services overrun, he said there was no need for people to be tested for the infection unless there was a reason to seek medical guidance.
"We are not saying to people who get acute respiratory symptoms, a cold or flu, to go and get tested for Covid-19," Murphy said. "We are saying that if you've come back from a return traveller or you've been in contact with someone, who has been a confirmed case, then you should be tested. But other Australians do not need testing, and all they are doing is putting an unnecessary burden on the testing."
The Morrison government has been rolling out elements of its stimulus plan since cabinet signed off on the package earlier this week.
On Wednesday, the prime minister pledged $2.4bn for a health package aimed at slowing community transmission of the virus. That package will fund up to 100 new pop-up fever clinics, a $30m advertising campaign and a Medicare item for telehealth consultations.
The government is due to unveil other significant elements of the package late on Wednesday evening. It has signalled that a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners through changes to deeming rates, and immediate financial support for small and medium-sized businesses will form part of the stimulus, as will cash payments to boost consumption.
