From the Royal Easter Show to the Wiggles: list of Australian events cancelled due to coronavirus
Sport, entertainment, arts and food festivals have all been affected by the pandemic. Here's what's cancelled and what's postponed
Multiple sporting events, concerts and festivals have been cancelled after the government recommended against any "non-essential" events with more than 500 people, to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
