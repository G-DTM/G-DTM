San Cisco, Mo'Ju, Alex the Astronaut and more: Australian music for isolated times
Each week we add 15 (or so) new songs to a Spotify playlist to soundtrack your physical distancing amid coronavirus – and help artists you love get paid
As some states around Australia begin to slowly open back up and Victoria heads back into shutdown, Australia's arts industry is still largely dormant – and the music industry was hit harder, and earlier, than most others. But until large gatherings and gigs happen again, there are small things you can do: it's an imperfect solution but streaming Australian music can help.
Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia adds some 15 new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat.
"Australian music needs all the help it can get right now," says Sounds Australia's Dom Alessio, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who've played Sounds Australia events.
"Streaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact."
