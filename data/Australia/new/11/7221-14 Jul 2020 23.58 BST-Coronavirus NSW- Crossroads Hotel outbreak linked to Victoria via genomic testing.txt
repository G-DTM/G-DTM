Coronavirus NSW: Crossroads Hotel outbreak linked to Victoria via genomic testing
NSW deputy premier John Barilaro says Covid-19 strain in Sydney's south-west suburb of Casula came from Victoria
Genomic testing indicates the strain of coronavirus causing a large cluster at a hotel in Sydney's south-west came from Victoria, the New South Wales deputy premier says.
The Crossroads Hotel cluster in Casula has now grown to 30 cases, 14 of those from people who attended the pub.
John Barilaro on Wednesday said genomic testing of the virus circulating in Casula found links to a strain from Victoria, where hundreds of new Covid-19 cases are being reported each day.
NSW Health contact tracer Jennie Musto explained the genomic link between Victoria and the NSW outbreak at a press conference on Wednesday, as a man travelling from Melbourne to Sydney at the end of June.
"A man from Melbourne came into a workplace in Sydney, and then there's some transmission within that workplace and then they all went to a party that night of the third of July, at the Crossroads hotel. So this is where it all began."
She said he travelled on 30 June, and works in the freight industryand that this case was linked to six colleagues who have been diagnosed.
NSW chief medical officer, Kerry Chant, warned that the potential spread of NSW's current outbreaks may not be limited to the Crossroads Hotel.
"Whilst we've had a very strong focus on the Crossroads, a hotel cluster, it is very important that we don't lose sight of the fact that Covid could have been introduced in any other parts of Sydney, and we may well have had transmission of the virus just continuing."
Chant also thanked a Covid-19 case in Blue Mountains who came forward for testing, and a clinician at Liverpool, who detected a link to the Crossroads cluster.
"They're actually the heroes ... those two actions by that individual and that registrar enabled us to put the puzzle together."
Musto said the Melbourne freight worker is not the Blue Mountains man, but that they both attended the Crossroads Hotel on 3 July.
The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian has said localised or statewide lockdowns were undesirable and options of last resort.
The intensive care capacity in NSW hospitals has almost quadrupled since the early stages of the pandemic, which has killed 51 people in the state.
"What we need to do is find a way in which we can coexist with the virus," Berejiklian told ABC TV on Tuesday evening.
Meanwhile a south-west Sydney pizza restaurant is closing for three days for deep cleaning after a customer tested positive for Covid-19.
Mancini's Original Woodfired Pizza at Belfield said NSW Health had deemed the case a low risk to staff as the male customer was there for about an hour last Friday and stayed within his group.
NSW Health reported 13 new Covid-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday, with 10 linked to the Crossroads Hotel.
The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, on Tuesday said seven additional cases had since 3pm on Monday been confirmed â€“ all linked to the Casula pub.
In a statement later on Tuesday, NSW Health said two further cases had been confirmed, both at the Planet Fitness gym in Casula.
The department is urging anyone who visited the gym between 4 July and 10 July to self-isolate and come forward for testing.
Both cases, men aged in their 20s, came forward for testing after it was established a case from the Crossroads Hotel visited the gym.
Police are working with Liquor and Gaming to investigate if the hotel breached any guidelines. All patrons of the Crossroads Hotel from 3 July 3 to 10 July must self-isolate and are being urged to get tested.
One of the cases linked to the hotel is a person who visited the Prestons Lodge Advantaged Care nursing home, which has been placed into lockdown.
Another case worked at the Kmart store in Casula Mall on 10 July.
Chant said other venues across Sydney may have been exposed to the virus between 27 June and 10 July after visits from people linked to the outbreak.
Berejiklian also on Tuesday announced a tightening of restrictions for pubs and hotels, including a cap of 300 patrons and mandatory sign-ins. Those restrictions will come into effect from Friday.
