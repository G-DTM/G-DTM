Super Netball: interstate teams to relocate to Queensland for 2020 competition
Hopes remain for some home games for non-Queensland clubs depending on border restrictions and health advice
Queensland will host at least the majority of the condensed 2020 Super Netball competition with all interstate teams relocating before 1 August start date.
Victoria's two teams, Melbourne Vixens and Collingwood, are flying north on Sunday and will be joined, at least temporarily, by teams from New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia.
Super Netball officials announced games, including the finals series, will be played in south-east Queensland at the Nissan Arena in Brisbane, the University of the Sunshine Coast Stadium and regional Queensland.
The eight-team competition will still be made up of 14 rounds and a normal finals series but will be played in a condensed format, meaning mid-week matches.
Super Netball bosses are hopeful that there still may be some home games for non-Queensland clubs based on border restrictions and the latest health advice.
The first phase of the fixture will be announced this week with the Victorian teams, who will quarantine for 14 days, set to square off on August 1.
Suncorp Super Netball CEO Chris Symington said the governing body was thankful to have the Queensland government's backing.
"This support from the Queensland government will ensure we're able to deliver a full 60-match season of the world's best netball to fans all over Australia and the world, so we thank them immensely for their support and for accommodating the entire league," he said in a statement on Sunday.
"We understand the sacrifice our athletes, supports staff and umpires will be making by relocating to Queensland for an extended period of time and we will be putting the necessary structures and processes in place to ensure they are all adequately supported during this time."
