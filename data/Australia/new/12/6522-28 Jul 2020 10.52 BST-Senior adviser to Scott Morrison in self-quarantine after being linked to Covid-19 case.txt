Senior adviser to Scott Morrison in self-quarantine after being linked to Covid-19 case
Nico Louw says he was told to self-isolate after being confirmed as a close contact of a coronavirus case at the Apollo Greek restaurant
One of prime minister Scott Morrison's senior advisers has gone into self-quarantine after being linked to a Covid-19 case.
Nico Louw posted on his Instagram account he had been told to self-isolate as he was a close contact of a confirmed coronavirus case at the Apollo Greek restaurant in Potts Point on 25 July. He later deleted the message.
The prime minster's office on Tuesday evening stated: "A staff member in the PMO is self-isolating after NSW Health issued a new alert last night."
"The acting chief medical officer advises that because the staff member has no Covid-19 symptoms, the prime minister is clear to continue with his plans," Morrison's office said.
The Seven Network reported Louw had tested negative to coronavirus but would remain in isolation for a number of days.
Morrison travelled to Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Tuesday morning before heading back to Canberra for meetings.
NSW Health on Tuesday said there had been three new cases linked to the Potts Point area cluster.
Two of the new cases visited the Apollo on Wednesday 22 July while the third case was a staff member of the restaurant.
The health department on Monday directed anyone who dined at the Apollo on 23-25 July inclusive "to quarantine for 14 days since their visit".
Publisher Hardie Grant reached a settlement with Louw in April over claims he distributed unauthorised copies of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's book, A Bigger Picture, before its formal release.
"An undisclosed sum was settled for and he's given us where he got [the digital copy] from and where it went to," the chief executive of the publishing house, Sandy Grant, told Guardian Australia at the time.
