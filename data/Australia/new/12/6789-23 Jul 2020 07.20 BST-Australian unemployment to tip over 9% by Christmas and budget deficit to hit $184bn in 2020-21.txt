Australian unemployment to tip over 9% by Christmas and budget deficit to hit $184bn in 2020-21
High debt necessary to provide people with support, treasurer Josh Frydenberg has said during economic update
Unemployment in Australia will creep over 9% by Christmas, and the federal budget will be in deficit to the tune of $85.8bn in 2019-20 and $184.5bn in 2020-21, according to a Treasury snapshot quantifying the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.
With bad news about new infections continuing in Victoria on Thursday, and New South Wales in a state of high alert, the Treasury provided a sober assessment of the economic shock accompanying the pandemic. It reported that economic activity in Australia will endure its biggest hit on record in 2020.
The update released in Canberra on Thursday underscores the negative hit to economic growth. Treasury says in calendar-year terms, real gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to fall by 3.75% this year, before rising 2.5% next year. In financial-year terms, real GDP will contract by 0.25% per cent in 2019-20 and by 2.5% in 2020-21.
As well as economic activity contracting and the budget sliding into the red, gross debt hit a new record – $684.3bn at 30 June 2020 – and the forecast is $851.9bn by 30 June 2021.
Spending on payments is up, and the tax take is down. Total receipts, which includes earnings from the Future Fund, were down $33bn in 2019-20 and are forecast to be down $61.1bn in 2020-21. Since the last mid-year economic forecast, tax receipts have been revised down by $31.7bn in 2019-20 and $63.9bn in 2020-21.
Payments are up by $187.5bn over the two years since the 2019-20 mid-year economic forecasts and are expected to be $550bn in 2019-20 rising to $640bn in 2020-21, reflecting the income support rolled out during the pandemic, and more Australians needing unemployment benefits.
Treasury says it does not know when tax collections will improve because the pandemic creates a degree of uncertainty that makes accurate forecasting difficult.
Given the Coalition told voters at the last federal election the budget was "back in black" before events led to the Morrison government unveiling the largest deficit since the second world war, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, were peppered with questions about when the budget would return to surplus.
Neither were prepared to quantify the length of time it would take to repay debt or return to surplus. Cormann said debt levels in Australia remained much lower than other comparable countries.
He also said the government believed it had no choice but to unleash substantial fiscal support. "You asked about the level of debt where we are here today – I ask you, what is the alternative?"
"Are you suggesting that we shouldn't have provided the support we did to boost our health system, to protect jobs, to protect livelihoods? I mean, in the circumstances what was the alternative?" he said.
Frydenberg said the outlook remained very uncertain. "Recent events in Victoria are a testament to this – a painful reminder how a setback in combating the virus can impact the speed and the trajectory of national economic recovery". He said the speed of economic recovery was contingent on containing the second wave of infections.
The Treasury says the fiscal support unleashed during the pandemic prevented the worst-case scenario. It estimates economic support increased the level of real GDP by around 0.75% in 2019-20 and will increase it by around 4.25% in 2020-21 relative to the case of no policy support.
The pump-priming also reduced the peak of the measured unemployment rate by around 5% preventing the loss of about 700,000 jobs.
The update contained economic and fiscal estimates for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years only – not the four year estimates that are conventional in budget and mid-year updates. Although the government did provide four-year updates for the spending measures associated with Covid-19.
The shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the outlook as captured in the update was "confronting".
Chalmers said the government had to do more than quantify the problem. It needed to give people a plan. "There were no new ideas on what the government presented today and there were very few new insights as well," he said.
"They told us that unemployment will keep rising – but they didn't tell us what they would do to respond to that. They failed to tell the 240,000 Australians that expect to lose their job between now and Christmas what they will do to respond to this jobs crisis."
