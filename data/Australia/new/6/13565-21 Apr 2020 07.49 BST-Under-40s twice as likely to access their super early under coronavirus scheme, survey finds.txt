Under-40s twice as likely to access their super early under coronavirus scheme, survey finds
'Cracking open your nest egg comes at a steep cost,' warning for young workers keen to release their superannuation savings
Those under 40 are twice as likely to access their super early as a result of the coronavirus than those over 40, according to a survey commissioned by Industry Super Australia.
However, the peak body is also warning against a potential rise in ineligible applications from wealthy Australians, after the survey found 46% of people who said they were "very likely" to access their super early had not yet lost their employment, and 40% of them lived in a household with income over $100,000 a year.
Treasury has estimated that 1.5 million people will apply for the scheme, which formally opened on Monday. It allows people to withdraw $10,000 from their super before June 30, and another $10,000 from July 1 to September 24 – all without tax – to cope with the economic shutdown caused by Covid-19.
Only those who are unemployed, eligible to receive jobseeker and other Centrelink payments, or have lost 20% of their working hours or turnover as a sole trader, can dip into their super.
But super funds have warned younger members that taking out $20,000 now could cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in future, as they miss out on compound interest and other investments.
Earlier in April, the corporate watchdog, Asic, warned landlords that they could face five years in jail for telling tenants to access super to pay rent as it could constitute unqualified financial advice.
The survey, conducted over two weeks at the beginning of April polled 1,100 people under the age of 65 who had super balances and asked if they were "very likely", "fairly likely" or "not likely" to use the scheme.
A third of respondents overall said they would be "very" or "fairly" likely to access their super early.
Among 18 to 19-year olds, 38% said they would be "very" or "fairly" likely to use the scheme, along with 43% of those aged 20-24, 39% of those 25-34, and 44% of those aged 35-39 year olds.
A third (32%) of 40-44 year olds also said they would be likely to access their super early.
However, only 21% of 45-49 year olds said they would, and 8% of those 50-54, 11% of those 55-59 and 14% of those 60-64.
Men were also more likely to claim their super early than women, with 58% of men aged 20-24 likely to claim compared to only 26% of women in the same age group.
The survey also found that 40% of those who said they were "very likely" to claim their super early had a household income of more than $104,000 a year – and many may not be eligible for the scheme.
Of those "very likely" to claim, 17% said they were still "in paid work" and were not worried about losing work. Another 29% of those very likely claimants said they were still in work but worried it would be affected in future, and 38% had lost employment.
One in five of the same group had a household income of more than $156,000 a year, the survey found.
A 10th were in households that earned between $130,000 and $160,000, 10% between $104,000 and $130,000, and 15% between $78,000 and $104,000.
Of the remainder, 12% were from households with income between $65,000 and $77,999, 11% between $52,000-$64,999 and 22% below $52,000.
The ATO website says that those who apply for the scheme "do not need to attach evidence to support your application".
"However, you should keep records and documents to confirm your eligibility as we may ask you for this information," the ATO says. "There are penalties for making false and misleading statements."
Industry Super Australia's chief executive, Bernie Dean, said regulators should start conducting random checks on applications after the results of their survey.
"The Australian Tax Office has assured us there is a robust compliance regime in place and those who deliberately flout the rules could face severe penalties," he said.
Dean also warned young Australians in financial stress to only access their super "as a last resort" after exploring other options.
"It is tempting to tap into your super early, some may want to do so as a savings buffer, but nothing in life is for free," he said. "Cracking open your nest egg comes at steep cost – it should be treated as a last resort."
