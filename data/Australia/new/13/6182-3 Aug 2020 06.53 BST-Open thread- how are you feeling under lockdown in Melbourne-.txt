Open thread: how are you feeling under lockdown in Melbourne?
With Victorians living under the toughest Covid-19 restrictions to date, we'd love to hear from you about how you're coping under the new rules
Almost five million Victorians are now living amid the tightest coronavirus restrictions ever imposed in Australia â€“ restrictions which will test people's mental and physical wellbeing.
The lockdown, which has been applied to Melbourne, will confine residents to their homes from 8pm to 5am (they can leave for medical reasons or for essential work) and imposes fines of $1,652 if they break curfew. Just one person in a household will be allowed to go to the supermarket, and only once a day, wearing a mask.
Exercise will be limited to once a day and no straying further than 5km from home.
There will be more police and army personnel enforcing the restrictions, and children will be stuck at home with schools and childcare shut.
Entire workplaces will be shut down with a huge impact on businesses and employees.
Messages of support for those doing it tough have been pouring in from other parts of Australia, but for many, the reality is grim. Life is on hold, work is scarce and it is the depths of winter.
If you are in Melbourne, how are you feeling living under the restrictions? What ways have you found to cope?
