When will community sports resume as Australia moves out of Covid-19 restrictions?
The government says some activities may open up next Friday as a result of loosening the coronavirus lockdown. Here's what the various phases mean for your sport
The Australian Institute of Sport has set out guidelines for how sport can get back under way following the coronavirus outbreak.
The AIS framework, developed in conjunction with various medical experts and sporting organisations, is based on a three-tiered system – levels A, B and C – designed to facilitate the gradual resumption of activities in a "cautious and methodical manner".
On Friday the government released its 15 principles for the resumption of sport and recreation, which said the AIS framework would provide a general guide, but decisions on when to implement each phase would be made in close consultation with federal, state/territory and local public health authorities
"Resumption of sport can significantly contribute to the re-establishment of normality in Australian society," the AIS states in its framework document. Here's how the path to "normality" looks for your sport.
