Bulldogs reprimanded after club great breaks NRL's biosecurity rules
Canterbury have been issued with a suspended fine of $25,000 for club great Terry Lamb's breach of the NRL's biosecurity protocols.
The Bulldogs received a breach notice on Friday night after Lamb spent time with the players and was photographed shaking hands with five-eighth Kieran Foran.
The NRL side was banned from gathering on Friday morning as Lamb, who isn't a part of their 50-person bubble, underwent a Covid-19 examination.
He was officially given a clean bill of health on Friday evening, paving the way for the team to resume preparations for Monday's clash with St George Illawarra.
The NRL's decision to suspend the fine came after they were satisfied that the breach was inadvertent, and the club immediately accepted responsibility and vowed to improve its compliance.
Acting NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo said it was a reminder that clubs, players and staff must ensure that the game's protocols were adhered to at all times.
"Our biosecurity protocols are stricter than current government health orders to ensure the health and safety of all players and staff in our ecosystem," Abdo said.
"The rules must be complied with at all times to protect the competition."
Lamb apologised to the club and the NRL in a statement.
"I was over excited about getting to Belmore again and wanting to wish Kieran all the best for his 200th game and in doing so I breached the protocols by shaking the hands of several players to wish them all the best," Lamb said.
"Although I was not standing in the restricted zone, I shouldn't have contacted players in the bubble, but in my over excitement I overstepped the mark and I apologise for that."
No one from outside club bubbles, including media and other club staff, are allowed to enter clean zones set up for registered players and staff.
