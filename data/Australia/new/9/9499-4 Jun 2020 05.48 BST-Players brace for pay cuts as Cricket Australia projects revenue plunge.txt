Players brace for pay cuts as Cricket Australia projects revenue plunge
Cricket Australia has projected a nearly 50% plunge in revenue that underpins player payments as the domestic game struggles to cope with the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Australian reported CA's revenue pool was originally forecast at around $400m in the 2020-21 season but had been slashed due to Covid-19's impact on the schedule.
Players are paid just over a quarter of the revenues as per their revenue-sharing agreement in their collecting bargaining agreement with CA.
The players union, the Australian Cricketers' Association, confirmed they had received revised revenue projections from CA and would hold a board meeting to discuss them later on Thursday.
CA chief executive Kevin Roberts said last week the board was facing a shortfall of about $80m in revenue due to the pandemic and there was a high likelihood Australia would not be able to host the Twenty20 World Cup in October and November.
The bleakest scenario looks to have been avoided, however, with India's lucrative four-Test tour, worth an estimated $300m in revenue, set to go ahead in the home summer.
CA had more than $90m in reserves at the end of March but stood down about 80% of its workforce in April to save some $3m in costs, a move that drew widespread criticism.
Several of Australia's state associations have also made deep staff cuts in recent weeks. Roberts last week flagged another round of cost-cutting, saying no part of the game would be "untouched".
