NSW bans state school formals, graduation ceremonies and choirs under new Covid-safe rules
Measures coming into force on Wednesday put limits on sport carnivals and forbid all social events
Formals, dances, graduation ceremonies, choirs and all social events have been banned in New South Wales government schools in an attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus.
A string of school closures, the latest being Sydney Girls high school on Monday, has prompted the NSW education department to announce new Covid-safe rules.
From Wednesday all public schools in the state will be required to adopt the changes to ensure that communities remain safe inside and outside the school gate, the department said on Monday.
Anyone with symptoms of Covid-19 is prohibited from returning to school until a negative test result has been reported.
Under additional measures for term three:
Students must remain within their relevant class or year group to limit mixing
Schools must not travel outside their local community or zone, including between rural and regional areas
Interschool sport and zone carnivals are restricted to 100 people a venue and must be held in the local area
Spectators, including parents and carers, are not permitted within school grounds or at sporting events held during school hours
All group singing and other chanting activities, as well as the use of wind instruments in group settings, are not permitted
Dance activities and drama group work can continue under a Covid-19 safety plan
School formals, dances, graduations or other social events are not permitted
Schools may hold a year 12 assembly at school without parents to recognise the completion of school, or consider delaying events until later in the year.
But students and staff required to support higher school certificate students are permitted to undertake activities to meet their HSC requirements with Covid-19 safety measures in place.
Organisations that use school buildings or grounds must have a Covid-19 safety plan and encourage strict compliance.
The restrictions are in addition to existing health advice for schools, including maintaining good hand hygiene, physical distancing for adults and the banning of non-essential school visitors.
