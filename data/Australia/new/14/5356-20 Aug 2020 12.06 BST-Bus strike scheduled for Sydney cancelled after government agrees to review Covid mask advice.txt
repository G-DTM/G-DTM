Bus strike scheduled for Sydney cancelled after government agrees to review Covid mask advice
The union says the NSW government has undertaken to review health advice and guidelines if community infection levels increase
Sydney bus drivers have called off a planned 48-hour strike after the New South Wales government agreed to their demands for a review of mandatory mask use on public transport.
The Rail, Tram and Bus Union met with government officials at the Industrial Relations Commission on Thursday in the hope the strike, scheduled for next week, could be avoided.
The union had sent a letter to the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, on Monday demanding that community consultation take place over government plans to privatise some bus services.
The letter also asked that mask use be mandated where the number of people on public transport outnumbered the green social distancing stickers. The union further asked for clarity on who was responsible for enforcing social distancing.
"The issue of mask-wearing on public transport has been significantly elevated this week and the NSW government has undertaken to review health advice and guidelines if community infection levels increase," the union secretary, David Babineau, said in a statement on Thursday evening.
"Bus drivers and their union will remain vigilant and we hope for a more constructive response from government to any future concerns so we can avoid reaching this point again."
The NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, thanked the union "for its decision to call off next week's 48-hour bus strike".
"Following constructive discussions with the union's leadership we will work towards a meeting on Monday," the minister said.
