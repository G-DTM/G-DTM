Woman allegedly spits and coughs on Sydney police officer sparking coronavirus fear
25-year-old then tells police she was travelling to have a Covid-19 test
A woman has allegedly repeatedly coughed and spat on a police officer in Sydney's south-west amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The woman allegedly failed to stop for police in Greenacre on Friday afternoon and accelerated to a speed believed to be above 120km/h.
She was later approached by police and arrested after being caught in heavy traffic on Roberts Road but allegedly refused to get out of the vehicle.
As she was being physically removed and handcuffed, the 25-year-old allegedly coughed and spat on the police officer and said she was travelling for Covid-19 testing.
She has since been charged with a number of serious driving offences and assaulting a police officer on duty. She was refused bail to appear at Parramatta local court on Saturday.
"Police will not tolerate being spat at in any climate, let alone the one we're facing right now. It's as simple as that," the NSW police assistant commissioner, Michael Corboy, said.
The woman was not showing any respiratory symptoms, police said, but the officer would nevertheless undergo Covid-19 testing.
