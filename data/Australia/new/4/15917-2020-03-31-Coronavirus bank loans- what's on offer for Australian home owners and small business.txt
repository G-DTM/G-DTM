Coronavirus bank loans: what's on offer for Australian home owners and small business

All the banks are offering a similar menu of relief for retail and business customers, although details of what's available differ between institutions.
What's set out below is as up-to-date as possible, but what's on offer changes frequently and you should always check with your bank before making any financial decisions.
We haven't included interest rate offers because they often change.
For retail customers, the key thing all banks are offering is to allow you to stop making repayments on your home loan for up to six months. It's important to note that interest is capitalised. That means it continues to accrue on the whole amount during this time and you will end up paying back more money. You can either increase repayments or extend the period of the loan.
Small business customers are being offered a similar deal, but there are also a number of fee waivers and reductions available that vary by bank.
The limits on who's eligible for small business support also vary from bank to bank.
