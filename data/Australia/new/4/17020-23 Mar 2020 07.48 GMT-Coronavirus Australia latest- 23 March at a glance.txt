Thousands of Australians queued outside Centrelink on Monday as the immediate economic effect of the shutdown of non-essential services began to be felt.
Huge lines, not seen in decades, extended several blocks outside Centrelink offices around the country. The government encouraged people to access welfare services through MyGov but the site was down for many people.
The government services minister Stuart Robert initially said the site had been subject to a cyber attack. But Robert was forced to take back his statement, telling parliament that it wasn't an attack but just the alarms that are designed to detect and stop DDoS attacks triggering due to the large volume of people trying to log in. The site can take just 55,000 people at once. At least 95,000 people tired to access it shortly after 9.30 am.
Up to a million additional people are expected to need the JobSeeker payment.
