For the second day in a row long queues formed outside Centrelink offices around the country as thousands of people affected by the coronavirus crisis sought financial assistance.
Anne Ruston, the social services minister, urged people to go on the MyGov website, instead of lining up.
"The day that you actually start your application with Centrelink will be the day from which you'll be eligible to receive your payment," she said.
"So we would be asking the Australian public for calm, because we need to make sure these services are open for those people who really are in the most desperate need for them."
But the site continued to have issues. Users struggled to access it due to the extremely high demand. Ruston said on Tuesday the government had increased the site's capacity to 150,000 users.
The government clarified that people not already registered with Centrelink did not have to go to an office to get a customer reference number (CRN). This can be done over the phone.
