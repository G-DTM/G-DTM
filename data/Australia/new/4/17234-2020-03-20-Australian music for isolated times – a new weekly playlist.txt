Australian music for isolated times – a new weekly playlist
Each Saturday we will publish a new list of Australian songs to soundtrack your social distancing. It'll also help artists you love to get paid
Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian will publish a playlist of new Australian songs to help bands who can no longer make money from live gigs, and to help fans who can no longer see them.
"With the cancellation of all gigs, events and festivals for at least the next six months, Australian music needs all the help it can get right now," says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia.
"Streaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact."
Here's the first playlist. Put it on repeat.
