'Worst time to be single': Melburnians share emotional cost of second lockdown in video diaries
As calls to the coronavirus mental health helpline spike in Victoria, Melburnians living under stage four lockdown talk about their feelings and experiences
Most Victorians are experiencing something few other Australians can relate to: being in lockdown for weeks on end, unable to leave their homes between 8pm and 5am, and limited to one hour of fresh air a day within a 5km radius of their homes.
On 24 August, the Victoria's deputy premier, James Merlino, told the state's Covid-19 committee that nearly two-thirds of calls and webchats to the national coronavirus mental health helpline Beyond Blue in July came from Victorians. He also said demand to Lifeline rose by 22% in Victoria in July, while demand to Kids Helpline from Victorian youth increased 8% in July compared with the previous month.
Melbourne-based video production company Monster &amp; Bear, which has Beyond Blue as a client, put a callout to people living in metropolitan Melbourne under stage four restrictions and asked them to share video diaries of their feelings and experiences living under lockdown. They have made the resulting documentary, available to view online. It details some of the anxiety people are feeling as their usual activities have been disrupted or cancelled.
Creative director of Monster &amp; Bear, Sarah Hickey, said people "shouldn't be ashamed of" their emotions during lockdown. "I think we all recognise this is a once-in-a-100-year event, and it's refreshing to see a city and the broader state giving each other permission to feel every kind of emotion on the spectrum," she said.
