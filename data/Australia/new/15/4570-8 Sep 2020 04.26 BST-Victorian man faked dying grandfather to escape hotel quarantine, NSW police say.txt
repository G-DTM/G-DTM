Victorian man faked dying grandfather to escape hotel quarantine, NSW police say
Police charge 30-year-old man who they allege falsified documents saying he was in NSW to visit his dying grandfather
A Victorian man spent the weekend free in Sydney after lying about visiting his dying grandfather in order to be released from hotel quarantine, police say.
NSW police have charged the man after he allegedly produced false documentation to leave hotel quarantine on Saturday.
The 30-year-old Victorian man arrived at Sydney airport without an exemption last Friday and was taken into hotel quarantine.
However, the following morning he was released from the hotel after providing what he claimed to be a valid exemption document saying he was in New South Wales to visit his terminally ill grandfather in hospital.
Police later determined the documentation he provided was false and further checks revealed the man's grandfather was not in hospital.
On Monday, police arrested the man at a home in Penrith, in Sydney's west.
He was charged with failing to comply with Covid-19 directions and producing a false or misleading application, and returned to hotel quarantine.
He is on bail to appear in Penrith local court on 12 October.
