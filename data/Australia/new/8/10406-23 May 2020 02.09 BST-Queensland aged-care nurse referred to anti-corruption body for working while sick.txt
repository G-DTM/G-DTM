Queensland aged-care nurse referred to anti-corruption body for working while sick
Woman had not received Covid-19 test results and continued to work at North Rockhampton Nursing Centre
A nurse who continued to show up to work at an aged-care home with symptoms for Covid-19 has been referred to Queensland's anti-corruption body.
The nurse continued working at the North Rockhampton Nursing Centre while she was sick but before she received test results.
She was suspended while an investigation was under way and is now in home isolation.
However, the health department has also referred her to the Crime and Corruption Commission over an alleged breach of the chief health officer's directions.
"Our focus remains on controlling Covid-19 and reducing its spread and protecting North Rockhampton Nursing Centre residents and staff, and the community, from infection," it said.
"The most important thing is that every single Queenslander knows that if they have symptoms they should get tested immediately and stay at home until the tests are returned."
The department is finalising the terms and references for an external investigation.
Initial tests for all residents and staff were negative. A second round of tests was carried out and results were negative. More results are due on Saturday.
A rapid response unit of 26 nurses was sent to Rockhampton to care for affected staff and residents who are in isolation and face more tests.
