'Gutting': News Corp Australia's newspaper print closures will leave 'thousands of stories' untold
Readers and former staff decry a terrible day for journalism and express grief at job cuts
Devoted readers and former staff of Australia's local newspapers have expressed their grief at News Corp Australia's announcement of significant job cuts and the print closure of more than 100 local and regional newspapers.
The media company's chairman, Michael Miller, said the papers would move to digital as the impact of coronavirus has hit the advertising spending that keeps the print papers afloat. Dozens of other local mastheads will stop publishing altogether.
Journalists and readers said this would leave a huge hole in local communities and "thousands of stories" untold.
The Nationals MP and minister for veteran's affairs, Darren Chester, said it was "gutting" to see the closures.
The former ABC managing director Mark Scott said it was "devastating" and the former politician and broadcaster Derryn Hinch said it was a "terrible day for journalism".
Other pointed out that many regional readers needed a print edition to access news, and that local papers played a crucial role keeping local government accountable.
