Police close case of rail worker's Covid-19 death after spitting incident
British Transport Police say no evidence to substantiate offence against Belly Mujinga
No further action will be taken in relation to the death of a railway ticket office worker who contracted Covid-19 after being spat at while on duty, the British Transport Police (BTP) have said.
Belly Mujinga, 47, fell ill with the virus days after a man who said he had Covid-19 spat and coughed at her and a colleague at Victoria station. She died on 5 April.
In a statement, BTP said senior detectives had concluded "there is no evidence to substantiate any criminal offences having taken place, and the tragic death of Belly Mujinga was not a consequence of this incident".
As a result, the matter will not be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service.
BTP said detectives had conducted "extensive inquiries" which included reviewing CCTV footage of the incident and speaking to witnesses.
Mujinga's death sparked a national outcry and a call for more protection for transport workers, with Boris Johnson condemning the incident. "The fact that she was abused for doing her job is utterly appalling," he said during prime minister's questions.
The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the case was a criminal matter, not about staff having more protective equipment.
The transport union TSSA called on the government to extend the coronavirus compensation scheme for health and care workers to the families of transport workers who had lost their lives.
DCI Sam Blackburn said: "I know the loss of Belly has moved so many people, and I can assure you we have done everything we can to provide answers for her family.
"As a result of our inquiries, we can now be confident that this incident did not lead to Belly's tragic death.
"Our thoughts remain with her family and we will continue to support them as they come to terms with the loss of their much-loved mother and wife."
